The most common use case for the Gluu Server is Single \nSign-On (SSO). Other common use cases include mobile authentication, \nAPI access management, two-factor authentication, customer identity\nand access management (CIAM), and identity federation. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a container distribution composed of software written by Gluu and incorporated from other open source projects. Gluu\nprojects are frequently prefixed with our open source handle: \nox\n (e.g. oxAuth, oxTrust). Any code in the Gluu Server that we wrote is MIT license, and is available on \nGithub\n. \n\n\nSaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more \nsecure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. \nBecause there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to \n\"top down\" implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why\nopen standards are so important for IAM. \n\n\nWhile there are many open protocols for IAM, Gluu focuses on just a few. \nConsolidation saves money, and one-off integrations should be avoided. \nOur goal was to support the most widely adopted older protocols, and the \nmost promising new protocols. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports the following open web standards for \nauthentication, authorization, federated identity, and identity management:\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0    \n\n\nSAML 2.0   \n\n\nOpenID Connect    \n\n\nUser Managed Access (UMA)    \n\n\nSimple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM)    \n\n\nFIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    \n\n\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   \n\n\n\n\nIf this is your first exposure to the Gluu Server, welcome to the \ncommunity! We want to see the ecosystem flourish, and ultimately make \nthe Internet a safer, more privacy protected place. In order to do that, \nwe believe we need to keep the Gluu Server free so all kinds of \norganizations can use, contribute and benefit from the software.\n\n\nThese docs are not perfect! Please help us make them so by submitting\nany improvements to our \nDocumentation Github\n.\nIf you're a Github pro, submit a pull request. If not, just open an issue\non any typos, bugs, or improvements you'd like to see. We need your\nhelp... even if you're not a coder, you can contribute! \n\n\noxd Client Software\n#\n\n\nGluu offers commercial OAuth 2.0 client software called \noxd\n to make securing and integrating applications with the Gluu Server easier. Your application can use any client software that implements the open standards the Gluu Server supports, but you may want to consider using oxd for the following reasons:\n\n\n(1). oxd is super-easy and fun to use; \n\n\n(2). We keep updating oxd to address the latest OAuth 2.0 security knowledge; \n\n\n(3). We can provide more complete end-to-end support if we know both \nthe client and server software;\n\n\n(4). oxd subscriptions help support this project so you can see more enhancements faster; \n\n\n(5). There are oxd libraries for Php, Python, Java, Node, Ruby, C#, Perl and Go. If your application is programmed in another language, oxd has a simple JSON/REST API;\n\n\n(6). There are oxd plugins for many popular applications like: Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, OpenCart, SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Roundcube, Shopify, and Kong. More are being added too.

After selling his ISP to\nVerio in 1998, Mike advised many large companies on identity and access\nmanagement, directory services, and application security. In late 2008,\nMike had a hunch that Web single sign-on was too complex, too\nproprietary and too expensive for many organizations. He felt that a\nutility approach to SSO using open source software could provide an\nalternative to expensive enterprise solutions. The Gluu Server was\nenvisioned as an integrated identity platform, based on free open source\nsoftware, to make application security available to significantly\ngreater number of organizations.\n\n\nVersions 1 and 2\n#\n\n\nVersions 1 of the Gluu Server was based on Sun OpenSSO and OpenDS. Mike\npresented the idea at an OpenSSO community group at the European\nIdentity Conference in Munich in May 2009. Version 1 worked a little,\nbut there was no easy way to manage it. Version 2 of the Gluu Server had\na better UI, but it was just a facade--the UI didn't actually do\nanything to configure OpenSSO. Version 2 was launched after Mike\nSchwartz met with members of the InCommon steering committee in San\nAntonio in October 2009. At that meeting, Mike expressed concern that\nOpenSSO might be end-of-life. Oracle had recently purchased Sun\nMicrosystems, and before ForgeRock was formed, it seemed possible that\nOracle would simply migrate OpenSSO customers to Oracle Access Manager.\nBob Morgan from the University of Washington convinced Mike that the\nShibboleth IdP was a reasonable alternative, and arguably had even more\nfeatures in SAML, including fine grain access release policies, and a\nbetter approach for multi-party federation. As the InCommon federation's\nefforts to evangelize SAML federation would support Gluu's message,\nswitching had marketing advantages, and would reduce the event risk\naround OpenSSO. Shortly thereafter, a new project from scratch was\nlaunched for Gluu Server v3 with the goal of using templates to simplify\nthe management of the Shibboleth IdP.\n\n\nVersion 3\n#\n\n\nThe first live demo of the Gluu Server was presented at an InCommon\nevent in Atlanta, GA in early November 2010. At that demo, Hakeem Fahm,\nthen IT director at the University of the District of Columbia, was\nimpressed and decided that the Gluu Server was exactly what his campus\nneeded to join InCommon. Delivering the first Gluu Server into\nproduction took three months. The order was placed before Thanksgiving,\nand it was finally delivered in early February 2011. Mike helped write\nsome of the python scripts (few, if any of which are still in use), and\nestablish the operating procedures for delivery of the Gluu Server. In\n2011, a few more campuses also adopted the Gluu Server.\n\n\nEnter OAuth2\n#\n\n\nOAuth2 had been on Gluu's roadmap since inception, but work started due\nto a consulting project Gluu had undertaken for\n\nIDCubed\n. This is the reason the OX software is\nMIT license--IDCubed insisted on it. The project was a flop--Gluu\ncouldn't deliver the graph based federated data solution quickly enough.\nBut as a result, Gluu was able to accelerate the launch of the OX OAuth2\nbased features, first with OpenID Connect in late 2011. Then in late\n2012, Gluu followed by introducing support for the User Managed Access\nProtocol, which Mike felt provided an Oauth2 based solution for access\nmanagement that was superior to Computer Associates' proprietary\nSiteminder access management framework.",

Java was\nchosen because there is a wide array of high quality libraries,\nconvenient container services, and tools for managing high performance\napplications at run-time. In order to run the Gluu Server, you don't\nhave to be a Java expert. But it does help to have some knowledge of how\nJava applications are deployed and managed in tomcat, or a similar\nservlet container.\n\n\nApache HTTP front end web server\n#\n\n\nAlthough there are pros and cons, we think its best to use the Apache\nHTTP server as the Internet facing Web server. There are a number of\nApache HTTP denial of service plugins. It is easier to handle re-directs\nfor things like discovery. And its convenient to have a non-J2EE way to\npublish static content. \n\n\nLDAP for Persistence\n#\n\n\nLDAP was chosen for persistence for a number of reasons: (1) we understood\nhow to scale an LDAP directory service horizontally to accommodate a data set\nof any size; (2) LDAP servers offer cost-effective and reliable replication\nservices; (3) as LDAP is a standard, the Gluu server would not be locked into\nthe persistence solution of one vendor; (4) LDAP had built-in support for SAML\nand OAuth2 components. In the future the OX project may develop additional\npersistence backends. But this is not likely for the near-term.\n\n\nWeb container plugins\n#\n\n\nToday, Web access management tools like CA Siteminder predominantly use\nthe web agent approach. Many large organizations have hundreds or\nthousands of \"web agents\" running on Apache and IIS.\n\n\nWeb agents are a great approach. Programmers don't have to know much\nabout the protocols. System administrators can configure the web server\nto use the central authorization server so we don't have to rely on the\nprogrammers to get security right. The programmers can obtain the user\nsession information in the environment variables. In OAuth2 information\nis serialized using JSON. For example, the entire id_token JWT is sent\nin one environment variable.\n\n\nIf developers want even more control, they can use the Gluu Server's\nAPI's directly: SAML, OpenID Connect, or UMA.",

Clusters require at least 8GB RAM for smooth performance. The requirements below are specific for Cluster Installation VMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of VMs\n\n\nCPU Units\n\n\nRAM\n\n\nRoot Partion\n\n\nPort Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2 CPU ea.\n\n\n8 GB\n\n\n40 GB\n\n\n4444 and 8989 (LDAP replication), 30865 (file system syncing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Above three ports should be opened in such a way that Node-1/host-1 can talk to Node-2/host-2 through these ports and vice versa\n\n\nNote:\n For convenience, the VMs are identified as \nhost-1\n and \nhost-2\n\n\nTimezone Requirements\n#\n\n\nIt is mandatory to keep the date and time synced between all the nodes of a cluster. It is recommended to change the timzone from UTC to local timezone where the cluster is situated or use a single timezone if the cluster spans multiple timezones. The timezone requirement is applicable to both the VM and the \nchroot\n container.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt is recommended to use a single timezone for all the nodes of the cluster in both VM and chroot.\n\n\n\n\nGluu strongly recommends using \nntpd\n in the VMs and run the \nntp\n daemon from \ncronjob\n to sync time. It is preferable if the cronjob is run every second to ensure smooth performance of the cluster.\n\n\nPreparing VMs\n#\n\n\nPreparing Node-1 of cluster:\n#\n\n\n\n\nInstall Gluu CE following the \nDeployment Page\n in \nhost-1\n. \n\n\nNOTE: you must provide hostname of the cluster itself to \nsetup.py\n script (\nidp.gluu.org\n in this example), not hostnames of individual nodes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing Node-2 of cluster:\n#\n\n\n\n\nGrab \nsetup.properties.last\n from Node-1/host-1 ( location: /install/community-edition-setup/ )\n\n\nChange attribute 'ip': Provide node-2/host-2 IP address here. \n\n\nRename \nsetup.properties.last\n to  \nsetup.properties\n\n\nPut this new file inside 2nd node's Gluu Server container ( location: /install/community-edition/setup/ )\n\n\nEnter into Gluu Server Container\n\n\nRun \nsetup.py\n \n\n\nNOTE: As it won't be running in interactive mode this way, make sure you'll provide all optional components (like Shibboleth, Asimba etc) you need to be installed explicitly with keys (run \n# ./setup.py -h\n for full list of them) Please be sure to read \nthis part\n in case you failed to setup the 2nd node using \nsetup.properties.last\n file from the 1st one for some reason, and resorted to installing it from scratch, that will call for additional steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP Replication\n#\n\n\nNOTE: Deployer need to perform LDAP Replication in Node-1/host-1 as user 'ldap'\n\n\n\n\nThings to know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost-1\n\n\nhost-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP Address eg. 192.168.6.1\n\n\nIp Address eg. 192.168.6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP admin pass\n\n\nLDAP admin pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\nldapGeneralConfigInstall.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreplicationSetup.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog into \nhost-1\n Gluu Server container\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \nldapGeneralConfigInstall.py\n in \nhost-1\n.

They must be initially copied by hand from one node to the other, and must be synced in this manner each time they are being updated.\nin each host, when required. Move to \n/etc/certs/\n on the 1st node (inside the container). Copy all keys, certs and key storages conforming to these masks: \nhttpd.*\n, \nasimba.*\n, \nasimbaIDP.*\n, \nidp-encryption.*\n, \nidp-signing.*\n, \nshibIDP.*\n, \noxauth-keys.*\n and \nscim-rs.*\n - to the same directory on the 2nd node (overwriting files that exist there; you may opt to backup them first, just in case).\n\n\nAfter that's done you still will need to update default system storage (\ncacerts\n file) at the 2nd node with these newly copied certificates. The \nCertificate Page\n contains the details about available certificates and how to update certificates are detailed in the \nupdate-certificate page\n.\n\n\n[Optional] Actions in case setup.properties.last method of installation didn't work for you\n#\n\n\nIn this case jks keystores you'll be moving to the 2nd node will be protected by passwords hardcoded into different configuration files on the 1st node, which are different from the similar passwords hardcoded into the same files on the 2nd node.\n\n\nThus you MUST ensure that the 1st node will be the one that will initialize the 2nd node during first csync's run (i.e., that it will win any conflicts due to changes in files that csync may detect during its very first run), as otherwise different components won't be able to decrypt these keystores and will fail.\n\n\nTo achieve this you should run initial sync manualy after completing configuring it, but before you install cron jobs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment out \nauto younger;\n string in \ncsync2.cfg\n on both nodes to disable autoresolution of conflicts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -crvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /\n on the 1st node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -crvvv -N idp2.gluu.org /\n on the 2nd node\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious commands did initial scan and filled metadata database. Now run \n# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /\n on the 1st node. That will try to sync files with the 2nd node, and most likely will fail to replicate all files due to some conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be now in a state of conflict, as certain files in directories to be synced differ between nodes and tool can't decide which to prefer. Run this \n# csync2 -frvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /\n on the 1st node to mark its files that are still in dirty state as the ones that will win any conflict next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun \n# csync2 -xrvvv -N idp1.gluu.org /\n on the 1st node to complete your initial sync. Now all your 2nd node's directories covered by csync should be identical to the 1st node's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncomment \nauto younger;\n string and proceed to installing cron jobs",

For more complicated topics and features, this document will link to dedicated sections within the docs where additional operational details are provided.\n\n\nAccessing the UI\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server administration interface is accessible by navigating to \n\nhttps://hostname\n (the one you provided during setup). When you \nfirst complete an installation, the default username is \nadmin\n and \nthe password is the same as the \nLDAP superuser\n password. \n\n\nWelcome Page\n#\n\n\nAfter successful authentication the administrator is taken to the \nDashboard. Some basic information about the VM/server is displayed as \nwell as the server version, free memory, and disk space. In the top \nright there is a user icon which can be used to log out of oxTrust. \nThe left hand menu is used to navigate the admin interface.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\nFrom the configuration tab, the Gluu Server administrator can manage \ncertain non-protocol related tasks.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three tabs in the organization configuration page:       \n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n         \n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n         \n\n\noxTrust Settings\n             \n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-service password reset: Allow users to reset their password via email. In order for this feature to work, the admin will also need to perform \nSMTP Server Configuration\n.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Support: Enable SCIM Support if you plan on using the SCIM protocol to move identity data from applications to Gluu and vice versa.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNS Server(s): If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be added here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Log Size (MB): By default the maximum size of the log file is 200 mb. This value can be increased or decreased depending on the organizations requirements.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser can edit their own profile: oxTrust has a profile section for each user. If this option is enabled, users will be able to log into oxTrust and edit the values associated with their user.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Email: This email will be displayed on all error pages with a note instructing users to contact for troubleshooting and  assistance.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server needs a mail server in order to send notifications. All fields in this form are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFields\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Host\n\n\nHostName of the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Name\n\n\nName of the sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email Address\n\n\nEmail Address of the Sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires Authentication\n\n\nThis Checkbox is enables authentication of the sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP User Name\n\n\nUser Name of the SMTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Password\n\n\nPassword for the SMTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires SSL\n\n\nThis checkbox is to enable the SSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Port\n\n\nPort number of the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust Settings\n#\n\n\n\n\nFrom the oxTrust Settings page the administrator can find the oxTrust build date and number, and manage the organization name, logo, and favicon. This page also contains the name of the Gluu Server administrator group. Users added to this group will have administrator access to the Gluu Server.\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three tabs included in the \nJSON Configuration\n menu:\n\n\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nFrom this tab you can access and edit the oxtrust JSON configuration file. \nClick the update button at the bottom of the changes to save any changes. \n\n\noxAuth Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. \nThis page also contains the supported response, grants, and algorithms. \n\n\noxTrust Import Person Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for \nthe file method of importing users into the Gluu Server. The administrator \ncan import users from an \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import \ndata in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields: \n\n\n\n\ngivenname\n\n\nsn\n\n\nuid\n\n\nfirstname, \netc..\n\n\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nManage LDAP Authentication\n#\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server administrator to define how and\nwhere the server should connect to authenticate users. If it is a remote\nLDAP/Active Directory server, the values are required. Put the details\nof the data source that you are trying to connect with Gluu Server. For\nexample, the data source can be your back-end Active Directory, or your\nlocal LDAP server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n This field contains the name of the authentication server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n The \nUsername\n for the authentication server (local\n  LDAP/remote LDAP/remote Active Directory) goes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This option can be used to define the total number\n  of simultaneous connections allowed for reading local LDAP/remote Active\n  Directory/remote LDAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Key:\n This field contains the primary key to connect to the\n  authentication server (i.e. SAMAccountName/uid/mail etc.). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Primary Key:\n This field contains the Gluu Server's internal LDAP primary key. Generally the key is either \nuid\n or \nmail\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n The unique name of the authentication server and port number\n  (e.g. auth.company.org:636) goes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n Add base DNs in this field to allow the Gluu Server to\n  connect and search the LDAP server. Every directory tree should be added\n  separately using the \nAdd Base DN\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This button assignes a password to\n  authenticate the \nAuthentication Server\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Enable SSL if the authentication server requires a secured port (e.g. 636).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to enable the keys that are inserted\n  in their respective fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeactivate:\n This button \nDeactivates/Activates\n the Gluu Server\n  accessibility for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest LDAP Connection:\n Use this button to check whether the provided\n  information is sufficient to connect to the authentication server. The\n  scan is done in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nThis allows the Gluu Server administrator to select the default\nauthentication method and level for person authentication. Both methods are\nset to \"Default\" until additional authentication mechanisms are enabled\nvia \ncustom scripts\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Method\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication mode\n\n\nThis mode is used when users login to applications via Gluu\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust authentication mode\n\n\nThis mode is used for authentication to the Gluu Server GUI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu Server uses oxAuth as the first step of authentication in all kind \nof SSO protocols ( OpenID Connect, SAML, CAS )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication mode: This mode defines the mode used for general authentication with Service Providers. The mode defined under this tab will not affect the users accessing the oxTrust administrator interface.\n\n\noxTrust authentication mode: This mode is used when the user is accessing the oxTrust administrator interface using the gluu server hostname.\n\n\nPassport Support: This mode uses third-party authentication e.g. Google+, Twitter, Facebook to authenticate users in Gluu Server.\n\n\nCustom Script Authenticaiton: This mode uses custom script and enabled in the oxTrust Admin UI.\n\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server exposes interception scripts in places where it is common \nfor organizations to implement custom workflows, or changes to the \nlook and feel of the Gluu Server. The most commonly used scripts are \nfor authentication, authorization, and identity synchronization. Each\ntype of script has its own interface--in other words, what methods are\navailable. For more information, see the reference page detailing each type of \ninterception script\n.\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is shipped with a very basic user registration \nfeature. For custom enrollment requirements, we recommend that you write\na custom registration page and use the SCIM endpoint\nto add the user record to the Gluu Server. Also, in some cases oxTrust is not Internet facing,\nwhich makes it a bad option for user registration. Use this feature\nonly if you have very basic requirements! \n\n\nThis tabs has two options:\n1. \nDisable Captcha for registration form\n\n2. \nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n\n\nDisable Captcha for registration form\n  \n\n\n\n\nThis option adds a required CAPTCHA to the registration form.     \n\n\nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n  \n\n\n\n\nThis section allows you to filter the list of attributes to be displayed \nin the registration form. Search, select, add, and order desired attributes here.\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nAttributes are individual pieces of user data, like \nuid\n or \nemail\n, that are required by applications in order to identify a user and grant access to protected resources. The user attributes that are available in your federation service can be found on this page. By default, only \nactive\n attributes are visible. Use the \nShow All Attributes\n button to display the \ninactive\n attributes too. \n\n\nCustom attributes can be added by clicking the \nAdd Attribute\n button and completing the simple form. Note that custom attributes must already be present in the LDAP server in order for them to be available for release by the Gluu Server. Adding an attribute here is like registering it in the Gluu Server--in order to release an attribute during a SAML or OpenID Connect transaction, the Gluu Server needs to know it exists. \n\n\nAttributes, as they pertain to SSO, are covered more thoroughly in the \nSAML Attributes\n and \nOpenID Connect Scopes\n sections of the docs.\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh, a.k.a. LDAP Synchronization, is the process of connecting one or more existing backend LDAP servers, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the Gluu Server's local LDAP server. \nCache Refresh\n periodically searches these data sources, compares the results to previous searches, and if a changed user account is found, it is updated.The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page via the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n. The \nkey attribute(s)\n is used to correlate a user if the user is found in more then one LDAP server. In this case, the two entries are joined. The source attributes specify which attributes will be pulled from the backend LDAP server. The backend server address, bind DN and other connection information is speciifed in the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab. More information on \nLDAP Syncronization\n can be found in the user management section of the docs. \n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer / View Log File\n#\n\n\nThis tool can be used to view file system logs. If you don't like to ssh, \nLog Viewer is your friend! Several common logs are preconfigured, or you can define \nnew logs by specifying the path.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page provides basic information about the Gluu Server such as the hostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the backend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page provides summary information about your SSL and SAML certificates.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nIf you deployed the Shibboleth SAML IDP or the Asimba SAML proxy during Gluu Server installation, you will see a link to manage inbound and outbound SAML requirements in the left hand navigation. Learn more about configuring and managing SAML in the \nSAML\n portion of the docs. \n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect protocol is supported by default in all Gluu Server deployments.

Interception scripts can be written in \nJython\n. Jython was chosen because an interpreted language facilitates dynamic creation of business logic, and makes it easier to distribute this logic to a cluster of Gluu servers. Jython enables developers to use either Java or Python classes. Combined with the option of calling web services from Python or Java, this enables the Gluu Server to support any business-driven policy requirement.\n\n\nThe web interface for Custom Scripts can be accessed by navigating to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scritps\n.\n\n\nInterception Script Methods\n#\n\n\nThere are three methods that inherit a base interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Methods\n\n\nMethod description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef init(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef destroy(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the \ninit()\n method\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef getApiVersion(self)\n\n\nThe \ngetApiVersion\n method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Currently all scripts should return \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfigurationAttributes\n parameter is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n with properties specified in \noxConfigurationProperty\n attributes.\n\n\nThe script manager only loads enabled scripts. Hence, after enabling or disabling a\nscript, the script manager should trigger an event to either load or\ndestroy a script, respectively. All scripts are stored in LDAP in the\n\nou=scripts,o=<org_inum>,o=gluu\n branch.\n\n\nHere is a sample entry:\n\n\n    dn: inum=@!1111!031C.4A65,ou=scripts,o=@!1111,o=gluu\n    objectClass: oxCustomScript\n    objectClass: top\n    description: <custom_script_description>\n    displayName: <display_name>\n    gluuStatus: true\n    inum: @!1111!031C.4A65\n    oxLevel: <priority>\n    oxModuleProperty: {\"value1\":\"module_property_name\",\"value2\":\"module_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxConfigurationProperty: {\"value1\":\"configuration_property_name\",\"value2\":\"configuration_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxRevision: <revision>\n    oxScript: <custom_script>\n    oxScriptType: <script_type>\n    programmingLanguage: python\n\n\n\n\nThe script manager reloads scripts automatically without needing to\nrestart the application once \noxRevision\n is increased.\n\n\nInterception Script Logs\n#\n\n\nThe log files regarding interception scripts are stored in the\n\noxauth.log\n file. The logs are separated according to the module they\naffect. The oxAuth custom script logs are stored in \noxauth_script.log\n\nand the oxTrust custom script logs are stored in the\n\noxtrust_script.log\n.

For example, you can write a script that\nenables a two-factor authentication mechanism like Duo Security. By\ndefault oxAuth offers basic username/password authentication. Authentication \nscripts allow an admin to implement more secure workflows to meet\nan organizations security requirements. It extends the base script type\nwith the \ninit\n, \ndestroy\n and \ngetApiVersion\n methods but also adds the\nfollowing methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nisValidAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is used to check if the authentication method is in a valid state. For example we can check there if a 3rd party mechanism is available to authenticate users. As a result it should either return \nTrue\n or \nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nusageType\n is \norg.xdi.model.AuthenticationScriptUsageType\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getAlternativeAuthenticationMethod(self, usageType, configurationAttributes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is called only if the current authentication method is in an invalid state.

It is needed in a few cases, for example when an authentication script redirects the user to a 3rd party authentication system and expects the workflow to resume after that. As a result it should return a java array of strings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\nstep\n is a java integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getPageForStep(self, configurationAttributes, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method allows the admin to render a required page for a specified authentication step. It should return a string value with a path to an XHTML page. If the return value is empty or null, the authenticator should render the default log in page \n/login.xhtml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\nstep\n is a java integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef logout(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is not mandatory.

People navigate to a protected webpage and the application redirects the person to the Gluu Server for authentication and authorization. The Gluu Server determines who the person is, and whether the person has the right to access the protected page. After a successful authentication, the Gluu Server redirects the person back to the protected page with an active session.\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is very flexible in handling authentication. By default, the Gluu Server uses username and password authentication. However, using the Gluu Server's interception script infrastructure, you can define multiple authentication methods and custom business logic for complex multi-step authentication workflows. You can have multiple authentication mechanisms active at the same time--Web or mobile clients can request a certain authentication type by using standard OpenID Connect request parameters. \n\n\nInterception scripts allow you to configure authentication processes and customize how they are applied. Sophisticated authentication logic can implement adaptive authentication. For example, you can add extra authentication steps based on contextual information such as fraud scores, location, or browser profiling. You can also customize the look and feel of a web authentication: html, css, images and javascript can be externalized and managed by your organization.\n\n\nBasic Authentication\n#\n\n\nBy default, LDAP is used to authenticate usernames and passwords. You can set a default authentication method for access to external applications, as well as access to the Gluu Server UI. Until additional authentication mechanisms are enabled via custom scripts, default authentication will always be some variation of username and password. \n\n\nConfiguring Social Authentication\n#\n\n\nDuring deployment of the Gluu Server you are presented with an option to deploy Passport.js. With over 300 existing \"strategies\", Passport.js provides a crowd-sourced approach to supporting social login at many popular consumer IDPs. Passport not only normalizes authentication, it also provides a standard mapping for user claims.\n\n\nLearn \nhow to use Passport.js\n to configure social login. \n\n\nConfiguring Multi-Factor Authentication\n#\n\n\nInterception scripts are used to implement multi-factor authentication. A number of scripts are included out-of-the-box, including scripts to support FIDO U2F tokens (like Vasco and Yubikey), Gluu's free Android and iOS two-factor authentication application called Super Gluu, certificate authentication, Duo Security, One-Time Passwords, and more. \n\n\nImplementation guides for each of the pre-supported authentication mechanisms listed above can be found in the pages that follow in this User Authentication Guide.\n\n\nIn addition, organizations frequently have custom requirements for multi-factor authentication. For instance, only users from a certain group should be prompted for two-factor authentication, or, only prompt users for two-factor authentication when trying to access protected resources from an unknown IP address. Custom interception scripts allow you to implement these types of policies, as well as any other business driven policy that can be scripted. \n\n\nLearn more about \nhow to write a custom interception script\n.\n\n\nReview our \ncustom authentication script tutorial\n, where we demonstrate how to write a script to implement OTP authentication using Twilio to send an SMS code for a two-step out-of-band authentication mechanism.\n\n\nConfiguring Account Lockout\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is shipped with a custom authentication script that implements a \nbasic account lockout policy which will deactivate a users account \nafter a set number of consecutive failed login attempts.\n\n\nThe script uses authentication settings provided in the \nManage LDAP Authentication\n tab within \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Authentication\n. In case the set threshold of failed logins is reached, the \u201cgluuStatus\u201d attribute of the user in question will be set to \ninactive\n and login counter is reset to zero.

Passport not only normalizes authentication, \nit also provides a standard mapping for user claims. \n\n\nPassport is an Express-based web application. We've modified it \nto call oxTrust APIs for its non-static configuration. Because its \nconfiguration is stored centrally in LDAP, you can scale Passport even \nin clustered topologies.\n\n\nThe Gluu Server needs only one interception script for Passport. This \nscript is included in our default distribution. Post-authentication,\nthis script uses just-in-time provisioning to add users to the Gluu\nLDAP server if a local account does not already exist. In this way, \nthe Gluu SAML and OpenID Connect providers can gather claims and maintain\nSSO as normal.\n\n\nBelow is a sequence diagram to help clarify the workflow for user\nauthentication and provisioning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu server calls Node-Passport server for JWT token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server generates a JWT token and provides it in response to Gluu server.\n\n\nGluu server requests Node-Passport server with JWT token to authenticate user for a social network provider.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user to social media authentication provider.\n\n\nAfter successful authentication of user, social network will callback Node-Passport server along with user details and access token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user back to Gluu server with user details and access token.\n\n\nGluu server\u2019s interception script will check if the user exists in LDAP server.

Enter the following command to start: \nservice passport start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nStrategies names and field names are case sensitive.\n\n\n\n\nHow to make a new app use Passport?\n#\n\n\nEvery provider has different protocols and ways to create the app. We \nwill look at one of the most common providers \"facebook\" and create a new app.\n\n\n\n\nLogin to https://developers.facebook.com\n\n\nClick on Add a new App from My Apps dropdown\n\n\nFill the required details and click the create Create App ID button to create the app.\n\n\nClick on the dashboard menu and get the clientID and clientSecret which can be used with the passport.\n\n\nClick on settings menu and put the domain of your gluu server in the App Domains field.\n\n\n\n\nNote: If there is a field for Authorized redirect URIs, make sure your apps list of Authorized redirect URIs contains the passport \nstrategy's callback. For example, if your gluu server points to \nhttps://example.gluu.org\n and the strategy is \nfacebook\n, the list of Authorized redirect URIs should contain \nhttps://example.gluu.org/passport/auth/facebook/callback.\n \n\n\nAdd new strategies to Passport\n#\n\n\nThe best way to add new strategies to Passport is to find an applicable npm module for your desired strategy. Let's start with an example. In this example we will consider adding facebook strategy.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add facebook strategy, search for passport-facebook npm module where you can select the npm module and then add the module to passport server.\n\n\nLet's say we found this module \"passport-facebook\" and want to use this module for facebook authentication. Install the module in passport by executing the following command: \nnpm install passport-facebook --save\n.\n\n\nConfigure the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the strategy\n#\n\n\nAll strategies are configured in the folder \nserver/auth/*.js.\n Next we need to create a file for the new strategy. Our strategy is facebook so we can create new file named \nfacebook.js\n and configure the strategy.\n\n\njavascript\nvar passport = require('passport');\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;\n\nvar setCredentials = function(credentials) {\n    var callbackURL = global.applicationHost.concat(\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\");\n    passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({\n            clientID: credentials.clientID,\n            clientSecret: credentials.clientSecret,\n            callbackURL: callbackURL,\n            enableProof: true,\n            profileFields: ['id', 'name', 'displayName', 'email']\n        },\n        function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {\n            var userProfile = {\n                id: profile._json.id,\n                name: profile.displayName,\n                username: profile.username || profile._json.id,\n                email: profile._json.email,\n                givenName: profile._json.first_name,\n                familyName: profile._json.last_name,\n                provider: profile.provider,\n                accessToken: accessToken\n            };\n            return done(null, userProfile);\n        }\n    ));\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    passport: passport,\n    setCredentials: setCredentials\n};\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the facebook strategy configured. For facebook \nthe required parameters are \nclientID\n, \nclientSecret\n and \ncallbackURL\n. You \ncan search for more configurations depending on the requirements and \nconfigure accordingly.\n\n\nThe function \nsetCredentials\n is used to configure the strategy of the \ncredentials of this strategy are been received. The parameter credentials \nholds the values that are stored in the oxTrust. \n\n\nThe parameter callbackURL should point to the callback route that we \nwill configure in step 4. As we are configuring facebook strategy, the \n\ncallbackURL\n can be set to \n\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\"\n \naccording the the convention of the app. You can customise the \n\ncallbackURL\n but it is recommended not to change the convention.\n\n\nThe callback function has different number of parameters and data in \nthose parameters which are required to be mapped to the userProfile \nkeys which are \nid, name, username, email, givenName, familyName, provider, accessToken\n. \nHere id and provider params are must. Provider param holds the value of \nthe provider, i.e for facebook the provider value will be facebook etc. \nIn most cases the value of provider is received in the user claims itself.\n\n\nThen export the strategy that we configured and also the \nsetCredentials\n \nmethod which will be used to set the details of the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy\n#\n\n\nWe are going to set the routes for the strategy that we are going to configure.\nFirst require the strategy that we configured in the previous step.\n\n\nvar passportFacebook = require('../auth/facebook').passport;\n\n\n\n\nHere \nrequire('../auth/facebook').passport\n will include the passport \nstrategy that we have configured.\n\n\nThen add the routes for the strategy. First we are going to register the \ncallback route and then the authenticate route.\n\n\nThe authenticate route first validated the jwt token that is been sent by\nGluu Server to passport server. If the JWT is valid then the user is \nredirected to the strategy and user can be authenticated there and the \nresponse of the user authentication is redirected to callback route.\n\n\nIf the callback routes receives the user data then user is been \nredirected to Gluu.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nscope value can be set from the strategy itself it it supports that \nor you can set the scope value here too.\n\n\nThe callbackResponse method return the control to Gluu server and \nuser is been enrolled in the system.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n#\n\n\nIn this step we are going to call the setCredentials method of the \nstrategy that we have created.\n\n\nGo to the file configureStrategies.js in auth folder of passport \nserver and require the strategy that we have created.\n\n\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('./facebook');\n\n\n\n\nAnd then in setConfiguratins function, call the setCredentials \nmethod if the strategy data is received.\n\n\n//FacebookStrategy\nif (data.passportStrategies.facebook) {\n    logger.log('info', 'Facebook Strategy details received');\n    logger.sendMQMessage('info: Facebook Strategy details received');\n    FacebookStrategy.setCredentials(data.passportStrategies.facebook);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will configure the passport strategy if the details of the \nstrategy are received from passport API.\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n#\n\n\nSo far the passport server is ready with the new strategy that we have \ncreated, but to call the strategy we need to add a button which calls \nthe new strategy.\n\n\n<a data-p=\"facebook\" class=\"provider\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" style=\"height:40px; width:120px\">\n    <img alt=\"facebook\" src=\"img/facebook.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\"></img>\n</a>\n\n\n\n\nHere the data-p and class=\"provider\" are required to call the strategy. \nThe data-p attribute should hold the value of the route that we created \nin routes.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nIn order to call the Strategy, the request URL to call the API must \nmatch the route that we configured.",

Provider param holds the value of \nthe provider, i.e for facebook the provider value will be facebook etc. \nIn most cases the value of provider is received in the user claims itself.

The respective \nXHTML\n and \nXML\n files are checked into the \nauth folder\n. The interfaces for authentication interception scripts can be found in the \nGluu Documentation\n.\n\n\nWe used the \nBasic Script\n \nas a template. The \nWikid forms\n \nwere also used as a template since it requires that we pass the value of the \ncode\n obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication to validate and authenticate the user.\n\n\nThe \nWikid authentication\n script was also looked upon for examples on how to process the form.\n\n\nImplement methods - Using Twilio SMS\n#\n\n\nSteps to add a custom template and pass values between 2 steps of authentication for our sample \nTwilio script\n:\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI;\n\n\nNavigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n;\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click \nAdd custom script configuration\n;\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, and Programming Language (Python will be by default);\n\n\nSelect the Level to set a security level;\n\n\nSelect Location Type for the script;\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type for the authentication;\n\n\nDefine Custom property, which in our example is provided by Twilio;\n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the script;\n\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the form and click \nsubmit\n;\n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, navigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Authenticaion\n > \nDefault Authentication Method\n and change the oxTrust authentication mode to \"Twilio\" (or the custom name of your script). \n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n     \n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.      \n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.      \n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.       \n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n    \n\nThe most important method to implement is the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value is stored in LDAP using a temporarily created attribute that can be retrieved in step 2. The step is sent to the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values as required.\n\n\nBelow are a few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as required:\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n   \n\n\nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\")\n Generates the code as required.     \n\n\nExample: \nrandom.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n   \n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to LDAP by creating a temporary attribute which has a limited lifetime and can be retrieved within the life span, otherwise it expires and the session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. \ncontext.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", <key>)\n where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\n\n\nExample: \ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n       \n\n\nUserService.instance()\n          \n\nGets the user login instance      \n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n         \n\nTo access  information from \nrequestParameters\n in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .     \n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n   \n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method accesses information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.      \n\n\nExample: \nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n       \n\n\ngetAttribute():\n    \n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, \ngetAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\")\n can be used. \n\n\nExample: \ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n     \n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n      \n\n\nrequestParameters.get(<key>)\n can be used to retrieve values passed from the form through the headers. This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\n\n\nExample: \nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n        \n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n       \n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy, where the number of steps depends on the context. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCheck the \nDuo script\n for a good example of how \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n can be used to implement adaptive authentication. The Duo script is scripted so that two-factor authentication is only presented for users in the IT group. The script checks for group membership and dynamically adjusts the number of steps. This can be implemented to check for any logic or attribute during the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n   \n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless, clustered two-step authentications.      \n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n     \n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive login, or even a custom first page, you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n method to specify the page you want to return for a given step.       \n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n      \n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using \ncontext.set\n. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the \nSessionState\n parameters which is defined in the code or program as \nsession_attributes.get(<key>)\n, where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.     \n\n\nExample: \nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n        \n\n\nSaving and Passing Values\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.       \n\n\nRetriving and passing values between steps\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute can be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, enabling values to be passed between multiple authentication methods for verification and validation. Generated code and the entered \"code\" in the form can be verified using a simple if and the \"code\" from the form can be obtained using the \nrequestParameters.get()\n method or \nserviceUtil.getFirstValue()\n method.\n\n\nCustom Properties\n#\n\n\nSometimes it is helpful to enable system administrators to enter properties that might frequently change. If administrators are not allowed to modify the script, the Custom Property feature can be used as illustrated in below screenshot:\n\n\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2\"()\n:\n\n\nTo access this information in your script with \nconfigurationAttributes.get(\"<key>\").getValue2()\n where \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve.\n\n\nReturning a message to the user\n#\n\n\nIt is possible to use the Context to return a message to the user, which could be especially useful if an error occurs or some kind of user action is required.\n\n\nAdding Libraries\n#\n\n\nPure Python libraries can be added to \n/opt/tomcat/conf/python\n, and jar files can be added to\n\n\n/var/gluu/webapps/oxauth/libs\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNote:\n jar files should be added within chroot. And not in the main \n/var/\n of the system.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nWhen the scripting is done, you can test the script by printing the statments to \noxtrust.log\n under \n/opt/tomcat/logs/\n. \n\n\nPrefixing the logs will help to find the script using tail command \ntail -f | grep <prefix>\n, the prefix logs will provide the script output while one trys to login using the script.\n\n\nIn the Twilio test script, a specific method called \nprintOut\n has been scripted to make it easier to add this prefix.\n\n\nAlso, remember that putting all the code in a \ntry / catch\n is a good practice to avoid unhandled exceptions, since during debugging exceptions may provide a hint at what's causing the issue.\n\n\nFurther logs to debug and monitor the sequence can be done using \noxauth_script.log\n and \noxauth.log\n under \n/opt/tomcat/logs/\n which is within the chroot.\n\n\nReverting Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nIt is not uncommon to get locked out of the Gluu Server while testing the authentication script.\n\n\nIn such a case the following method can be used to revert back to the older authentication method:\n\n\n\n\nOpen LDAP in a LDAP Browser (jxlorer is used here and recommended).\n\n\nNavigate to \"gluu > appliances > {GUID or applicance number}\". \n\n\nSearch for \"oxAuthenticationMode\"  and \"oxTrustAuthenticationMode\" attribute and delete the values. \n\n\nOxAuthenticationMode attribute is used for Login pages, which stores the name of the custom script used.\n\n\nOxTrustAuthenticationMode is used for OxTrsut Admin UI page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the changes.\n\n\nTry to access the login page or Gluu Admin UI.\nAs a secondary option, InPrivate or Incognito or Private Browser from various Browsers can be used.",

During installation, the Gluu Server creates\na default objectclass specific for your organization. If you view\n\n/opt/opendj/config/schema/100-user.ldif\n, you'll see an objectclass called\nsomething like \nox-43A94B45403D3B0A00010D87EAF2\n (where this number is your \norganization identifier.) Any objects you add through the UI will be added to this\nobjectclass. In the JSON configuration for oxTrust, you'll see two properties: \n\npersonObjectClassTypes\n and \npersonCustomObjectClass\n where this objectclass is\nreferenced. Also, you'll see the display name for this objectclass referenced in \nthe \npersonObjectClassDisplayNames\n property (default value is \"custom\"). \n\n\nOpenID Scopes\n#\n\n\nIn OpenID Connect, scopes are used to group attributes, and to provide a human \nunderstandable description of the attributes. This improves usability when you need \nto prompt a person to approve the disclosure of attributes to a third party. For\nexample, instead of asking the user if its ok to release her address,\ncity, state, and country, and providing a description of each attribute,\nit may be easier to ask the person if its ok to release \"mailing address\ninformation.\" In situations where the attributes may confuse the person,\nOpenID Scopes are a really good thing. Although the OpenID Connect spec says an OP\n\nmay release individual scopes, the Gluu Server only releases scopes. \n\n\nAn example of the default Gluu Server authorization request can be seen\nhere:\n\n\n\n\nSo if you have custom attributes, you may need to define a custom OpenID Scope.\nThis is pretty easy to do using the oxTrust user interface, and you can just\nselect the attributes that you previously registered.\n\n\nWhat attributes to put in what scopes depends on your privacy requirements.\nIf there is an attribute that is particularly sensitive, it may need its own\nscope (i.e. a scope with just one attribute). A good example of this is\n'dateOfBirth.' For minors, this can be sensitive information, and your\norganization may need more control about which OpenID Connect clients with\nwhich to share this scope.\n\n\nIn oxTrust configuration, be careful about making a scope available by\ndefault. This would mean that any client that registers via Dynamic Client\nRegistration could request this scope. The OpenID Connect specification only\nrequires the release of the \nopenid\n scope, which should just contain the\nperson identifier in the domain (i.e. for Google, this would be your Google id).\nHowever, rules were meant to be broken, so if you have a reason to release\na scope by default, go for it!\n\n\nCustom NameID\n#\n\n\nGluu Server comes with the \ntransientID\n attribute which is the default \nNameID\n.\nIf there are other \nNameID\n requirements, it is possible to create them as well.\nThe custom attribute must be created in oxTrust first before defining it as the \nNameID\n.\nPlease see the \noxTrust custom attribute guide\n to create the custom attribute in oxTrust.\n\n\nDefining NameID\n#\n\n\nThe template file for \nNameID\n definitions are located in the \nattribute-resolver.xml.vm\n file under \n/opt/tomcat/conf/shibboleth2/\n.\nThe example below adds \ntestcustomattribute\n as \nNameID\n based on UID attribute. The following are put into the \nattribute-resolver.xml.vm\n file.\n\n\n\n\nAdd declaration for the new attribute\n\n\n\n\nif( ! ($attribute.name.equals('transientId') or $attribute.name.equals('testcustomattribute') ) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd definition for the new attribute\n\n\n\n\n <resolver:AttributeDefinition id=\"testcustomattribute\" xsi:type=\"Simple\"\n                              xmlns=\"urn:mace:shibboleth:2.0:resolver:ad\"\n                              sourceAttributeID=\"uid\">\n\n        <resolver:Dependency ref=\"siteLDAP\"/>\n        <resolver:AttributeEncoder xsi:type=\"SAML2StringNameID\"\n                                xmlns=\"urn:mace:shibboleth:2.0:attribute:encoder\"\n                                nameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent\" />\n</resolver:AttributeDefinition> \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart tomcat service\n\n\n\n\nManual Schema Management Command\n#\n\n\nLet's say you have a lot of attributes to register. Or you want a more\nrepeatable process for adding schema to the Gluu Server. This next section\nwill document a slightly more geeky way to do automate the process.\n\n\nFirst of all, you should create a custom schema file, which you will copy \nto \n/opt/opendj/config/schema\n each time you configure a new Gluu Server.\nUse your organization name, for example something like 102-acme.ldif. \nFor more information about creating custom schema in OpenDJ, see the \n[ForgeRock OpenDJ Admin Guide]\n(https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/opendj/2.6/admin-guide/chap-schema). \nYou should consider prefixing the name of your attributes and objectclasses\nwith your organization. For example, instead of using \nspamId\n use \nacmeSpamId\n.\nRestart your LDAP server to make sure the schema is correct. If it's not, the\nOpenDJ server will not start.\n\n\nNow you have the objectclass and attributes in OpenDJ, but the Gluu Server\nstill does not know about them. You're going to have to \"register\" these \nattributes. Each attribute that you want to make available must have a \ncorresponding LDAP entry under \nou=attributes,o=<org-inum>,o=gluu\n. If \nyou browse your LDAP server after performing a Gluu Server base installation, \nyou will see that many commonly used attributes are already there. When an \nLDAP entry exists for your attribute, it is considered to be \"registered\". \nNote in this example, we are using @!1111 as the organization id, which will\nbe much longer in a real installation.\n\n\nThere are two ways you can register an attribute. If you are an LDAP\ngeek, you can just create an LDIF file with the correct information, and\nload it in the LDAP server that is storing your configuration. If you\nwant to quickly spool up new Gluu Servers, this is probably the quickest\nway to handle it.\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1111!0005!2B29,ou=attributes,o=@!1111,o=gluu\nobjectClass: top\nobjectClass: gluuAttribute\ninum: @!1111!0005!2B29\ndescription: How a person would want their name to be presented in writing.\ndisplayName: Display Name\nurn: urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:displayName\ngluuAttributeName: displayName\ngluuAttributeOrigin: gluuPerson\ngluuAttributeType: string\ngluuAttributeEditType: user\ngluuAttributeEditType: admin\ngluuAttributeViewType: user\ngluuAttributeViewType: admin\ngluuStatus: active\n\n\n\nA few things to note: \n\n\n\n\nFor the \ninum\n, after \n0005!\n use a unique identifier--normally a four digit hex number.\n\n\nIf you are using SAML, you will need to make sure that each attribute has a unique \nurn\n.\n  If you don't like \nurn\n format, you can use a dns style name here. It supposed to be globally unique. \n\n\nMake sure \ngluuStatus\n is active\n\n\nSet the appropriate description and displayName if possible.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have this ldif file, you should make sure you use \nldapmodify\n to load it after the during\nyour Gluu Server installation process. \n\n\nIf you also want to automate loading your custom OpenID scopes, just remember that these\nscopes reference the DN of the attributes. For example: \n\n\ndn: inum=@!1111!0009!341A,ou=scopes,o=@!1111,o=gluu\nobjectClass: oxAuthCustomScope\nobjectClass: top\ndefaultScope: false\ndescription: myScope\ndisplayName: myScope\ninum: @!43A9.4B45.403D.3B0A!0001!0D87.EAF2!0009!341A\noxAuthClaim: inum=@!1111!0005!2B29,ou=attributes,o=@!1111,o=gluu\noxAuthClaim: inum=@!1111!0005!29DA,ou=attributes,o=@!1111,o=gluu\n\n\n\nSo you may want to also create an ldif file for each scope, and also load this at installation time.",

In the \"pull\" mode, otherwise known as LDAP Synchronization or Cache Refresh, the Gluu Server can use one or more existing LDAP identity sources (like Microsoft Active Directory) as the authoritative source of identity information. To \"push\" identities to the Gluu Server you can use the JSON/REST SCIM API. Local user management can also be performed inside oxTrust. Each method is detailed below.\n\n\nLocal User Management\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust, you can add, edit and manage people, groups and user\nattributes and claims to ensure the proper information is released about\nthe right people.\n\n\nManage People\n#\n\n\nTo manage people, navigate to \nUser\n > \nManage People\n.\n\n\nFrom this interface you can add and search users. Because the user database can potentially be very large, a value is required in the search field. In other words, you can not click search with a blank entry to populate all users. If you need to see all users, this would be best performed manually within the Gluu LDAP server. Upon performing a user search in oxTrust a list will be populated with all users that match the search.\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a user, simply click on any of the hyperlinks associated with\nthat user and you will be taken to a user management interface where you\ncan modify specific attributes relating to that user.\n\n\n\n\nManage Groups\n#\n\n\nOut of the box, the Gluu Server includes one group: the Gluu Manager\nGroup (\ngluuManager\n). Groups can be added and populated as\nneeded. By using the \nManage Groups\n feature, the Gluu Server\nAdministrator can add, delete or modify any group or user within a\ngroup. The list of available groups can be viewed by hitting the\n\nSearch\n button with a blank search box.\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server Administrator can modify information such as Display\nName, Group Owner, Visibility type etc. The Server Administrator can\nalso add or delete users within existing groups. The group information\nis represented as shown below.\n\n\n\nIf any member of the Organization is required to be added in any\nspecific group, this can be achieved be clicking on the Add Member\nbutton. The flow is \nAdd Member --> Search the name/email of the user\n--> Select the user --> Click OK --> Update.\n\n\n\n\nImport People\n#\n\n\nGluu Server allows the administrator to import users from a file. This can be accessed by navigating to \nUsers\n > \nImport People\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd\n button to select the file from which the users will be imported. This feature has been tested with a \nxls\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the \nValidate\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nImport\n button to complete the import of users.\n\n\n\n\nFile Structure\n#\n\n\nThe file needs to contain the following fields from which the user data will be pulled. Please remember to use the exact spelling as shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDAP Synchronization\n#\n\n\nLDAP Synchronization, a.k.a. Cache Refresh, is the process of connecting \none or more existing backend LDAP servers, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the\nGluu Server's local LDAP server. Synching people and attributes from a \nbackend server into the Gluu Server speeds up authentication transactions. \nIt is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of \nattributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. \nTransformations are stored in the Gluu LDAP service. \n\n\nVideo Tutorial\n#\n\n\nFor a guided video overview of configuring Cache Refresh, please watch the following three videos:  \n\n- \nPart 1: What is 'Cache Refresh' and How Does it Work?\n   \n\n- \nPart 2: Configuring Cache Refresh in the Gluu Server\n  \n\n- \nPart 3: Managing Authentication After You've Setup Cache Refresh\n    \n\n\nThings To Remember\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports two LDAP modes: \n\n\n\n\nAuthentication \n\n\nIdentity mapping\n\n\n\n\nOnly sometimes is it the same LDAP server. To synchronize user accounts from an external LDAP directory server, you can use the built-in oxTrust features for Cache Refresh, which supports mapping identities from one or more source directory servers.\n\n\nAfter configuring Cache Refresh, you should give it some time to run and populate the LDAP server. Here are some tips before you get started:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable 'Keep External Person' during CR setup. This will allow your\n  default user 'admin' to log into Gluu Server after initial Cache \n  Refresh iteration. If you do not enable 'Keep External Person', your \n  'admin' user including all other test users will be gone after first \n  Cache Refresh iteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are using LDAP authentication, not VDS. You will only\n  need VDS setting if you are using the Radiant Logic Virtual Directory\n  Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the snapshots folder to see if files are being created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the oxTrust admin to browse users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the command \nldapsearch\n to check to see if results are starting\n  to come in. The following command will search for the total number of\n  users in the Gluu LDAP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -Z -X -D \"cn=directory manager\" -w 'pass_of_ldap_ -b 'ou=people,o=DA....,o=gluu' dn | grep \"dn\\:\" | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to login with one of these users. We assume that you have also\n  setup your Gluu Server to use the correct LDAP server for\n  authentication.\n\n\n\n\nThings To Know\n#\n\n\nThe deployer needs to know various values of his own backend AD to\nconfigure this part. For example, host & port, bindDN user information,\nbindDN password, Objectclasses, attributes whose information will be\npulled etc.\n\n\nIn addition, the deployer also needs to know generic information of his\nGluu Server's LDAP. By default, the deployer can use 'localhost:1636',\n'cn=directory manager', 'password what he chose during installation',\n'ou=people,o=site' as server information, bindDN, bindDN password and\nbaseDN respectively.\n\n\nAfter collecting this information, the deployer can move forward with\nthe setup of the Cache Refresh engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Run:\n The date and time of the latest cache refresh cycle\n  completion is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates at the Last Run:\n This shows the total number of users who\n  have been updated in the last Cache Refresh cycle. For example an user\n  who has any of his attribute updated will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem at the Last Run:\n This shows the number of users who have\n  been rejected by the Gluu Server during the update. If there are any\n  rejections, please contact Gluu Support for clarification and help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Backend Key and Attributes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Attribute:\n This is the unique key attribute of backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP Server such as SAMAccountname for any Active Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n This contains the Object Classes of the backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP which has permission to talk to Gluu Server Cache Refresh\n  such as person, organizationalPerson, user etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Attribute:\n This contains the list of attributes which will be\n  pulled and read by the Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LDAP Filter:\n If there is any custom search required, this\nfiltering mechanism can be used such as \"sn=*\" whereas the value of this\nfield ensures that every user must contain an attribute named SN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server to connect to the backend Active\nDirectory/LDAP server of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Please input \nsource\n as the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Anonymous Bind:\n Some customers do now allow username/password\n  connections to their backend server. Enable this option if this applies\n  to your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n This contains the username to connect to the backend\n  server. You need to use full DN here. As for example,\n  \ncn=gluu,dc=company,dc=org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Use this feature if the backend server allows SSL\n  connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This value defines the maximum number of\n  connections that are allowed to read the backend Active Directory/LDAP\n  server. It is recommended to keep the value of 2 or 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n This contains the backend Active Directory/LDAP server\n  hostname with port i.e. backend.organization.com:389. If organization\n  has a failover server, click \nAdd Server\n and add more hostnames with\n  port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n This contains the location of the Active Directory/LDAP\n  tree from where the Gluu Server shall read the user information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to save and push the changes. Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non \nAdd source LDAP server\n and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a \nfailover server\n is not a new server.\n\n\nInum LDAP Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh Method:\n The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVDS Method:\n Any organization with a database like \nmysql\n can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Method:\n If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the \nCopy\n  Method\n from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes Mapping\n#\n\n\nWhen the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nIn the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.\n\n\nThe Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPooling Interval (Minutes):\n This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript File Name:\n The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Folder:\n Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings \nUpdated at the last run\n and\n    \nProblems at the last run\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Count:\n This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer IP Address:\n Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved Script File Name location:\n New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server. Hit this button only when the values have been entered,\n    completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate and Validate Script:\n This button is used to test the\n    operation and integrity of any custom script such as a Jython Script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Registration\n#\n\n\nSelf-Registration is done by users on a self-service basis. Since\noxTrust user registration cannot add users to a backend LDAP or Active\nDirectory server, self-registration will only be effective if GluuLDAP\nis used for authentication of users.\n\n\nBY default a a limited number of attribute is present in default\nself-registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added\nin Registration Management of Organization Configuration\nThe oxTrust component provides a very basic user registration service for \nthe people to sign-up for an account on the Gluu Server. This service is \ndisabled by default. The \nUser Registration\n custom script  is used to enable the \nregistration feature.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen possible, we recommend handling user registration in your app locally, then pushing the information to the Gluu Server via SCIM 2.0. This will give you much more control and flexibility in defining the exact registration process. Also, frequently oxTrust is not Internet facing--it was primarily designed as an interface for admins.\n\n\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nNavigate to the custom scripts section of the Admin Panel. Click on \nConfiguration\n then \nManage Custom Scripts\n.\n\n\nThe tabs near the top of the page can be used to navigate to different custom scripts. Navigate to the \nUser Registration\n tab.\n\n\n\n\nSet the \nenable_user\n value to \ntrue\n so that the user can login as soon as the registration is complete. If you want to manually review and approve new user registrations, you can leave this value set to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nEnable\n checkbox at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\nNow users should be able to self-register through the user registration link, which should be available at \n<hostname>/identity/register\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0\n#\n\n\nThis section outlines how to add/remove user from Gluu Server CE using \nSCIM-Client\n.\n\n\nAdd User\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods to add users:\n\n\n\n\nJSON Sting\n\n\nUser Object\n\n\n\n\nRequired Parameters\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserName\n\n\nThe intended username for the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngivenName\n\n\nThe first name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfamilyName\n\n\nThe last name of the end-user\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplayName\n\n\nThe formatted first name followed by last name\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroups\n\n\nOptional parameter if the user is added to any specific group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON String\n#\n\n\nThe user is added using a JSON object string using the required parameters; however it is possible to add more parameters.

            "text": "SAML\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nSAML is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging \nauthentication and authorization data between an identity provider \n(like the Gluu Server) and a service provider (like Dropbox, O365, etc.). \nSAML is a stable and mature standard, and is well supported at many of the \nInternet's largest domains. However, the last major release of SAML was in 2005! \nTherefore it is important to understand when to use SAML and when to use a \nnewer protocol like OpenID Connect to achieve your identity goals. \n\n\nRefer to these four considerations to determine which protocol \nto use for single sign-on (SSO):\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an application that already supports SAML, use SAML.\n\n\nIf you need to support user login at an external IDP (like a customer or partner IDP), use SAML.\n\n\nIf you have a mobile application, use OpenID Connect.\n\n\nIf you are writing a new application, use OpenID Connect.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are continuing with the SAML documentation it is presumed your use case aligns with one or both of the first two bullet points above. If not, we recommend that you review the \nOpenID Connect\n portion of the Gluu Server docs. \n\n\nOutbound vs. Inbound SAML\n#\n\n\nThere are two main SAML authentication workflows: outbound SAML and inbound SAML. \n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. \nIn an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) redirects a user to a \ndesignated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. \nThe IDP asks for the user's credentials and upon successful authentication redirects the user to the protected content. \n\n\nInbound SAML enables an organization to offer SAML authentication as a front door to their digital service. Inbound SAML is a common requirement for SaaS providers who need to support the authentication requirements of large enterprise customers.\n\n\nThe typical user flow for inbound SAML is as follows: \n\n\n\n\nUser tries to access your protected resource;    \n\n\nUser is redirected to a discovery page (presented by your IDP) that presents one or more external IDP's that they may have existing credentials at (their \"home IDP\");   \n\n\nUser selects their home IDP and is sent for authentication;   \n\n\nUpon successful authentication at their home IDP, user is redirected back to your service with access to the protected resource. \n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server bundles separate components to support both workflows (installation of each component is optional during Gluu Server deployment):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor outbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the Shibboleth SAML IDP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor inbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the Asimba SAML Proxy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation for each service follows in the sections below. \n\n\nOutbound SAML (Shibboleth)\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) \nor traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) \nredirects a user to a designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication \nand authorization. The IDP will ask for the user's credentials and upon successful \nauthentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. \n\n\nIn order for this transaction to happen successfully there must be pre-established \ntrust between the IDP and the SP. In the Gluu Server, the IDPs SSO configuration is \ncalled a Trust Relationship (TR). The following sections cover how to create a TR in the Gluu Server. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor any outbound SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created in the IDP.\n\n\n\n\nTrust Relationship Requirements\n#\n\n\nEach Trust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.\n\n\nMetadata of the SP\n     \n\nMetadata is an XML file which has configuration data used to establish trust between the website (SP) and IDP (Gluu Server). Websites (SP) can provide metadata via a URL or as a separate file. Metadata can change, so a static URL typically requires the least amount of ongoing maintenance. \n\n\nRequired Attributes\n    \n\nEach SP may require one or many attributes in order to grant a user access. \nRequired attributes vary depending on the application, and should be \nexplicitly listed in the application's documentation. The Gluu Server ships with \ncertain preconfigured attributes and also supports the creation of custom attributes. \nOnce the attributes are available in the Gluu Server, the administrator only needs \nto click on the desired attribute(s) and it will be released to the SP upon \nsuccessful user authentication.\n\n\nCreate a Trust Relationship in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nSAML\n > \nTrust Relationships\n\n\nClick on \nAdd Trust Relationship\n\n\nA new page will appear where you can provide all the required information to create a Trust\n  Relationship(TR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)     \n\n\nDescription\n: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.    \n\n\n\n\nMetadata Type\n: There are four available options to choose from. The correct Type depends on how the SP is delivering Metadata to your IDP.      \n\n\n\n\nFile\n: Choose File if the SP has provided an uploadable metadata document in XML format.\n\n\nURI\n: Chose URI if the SP metadata is hosted on a URI that is accessible from the Internet.\n\n\nGenerate\n: Choose Generate if the SP is an \"inhouse application\" or the \u201cShibboleth SP\u201d is going to be installed in the target application (SP). This option will generate a how-to guide for installing the Shibboleth SP. If you plan on using the Generate method, please note the following:        \n\n        * \nURL\n : This is the hostname of the SP.   \n\n        * \nPublic certificate\n : You must provide the certificate, which is a Base64 encoded ASCII file, and contain \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\". This certificate \ncan not\n be password protected.             \n\n        * After creating the Trust Relationship, download the generated configuration files from the \nDownload Shibboleth2 configuration files\n link and place these configuration files inside your SP configuration.         \n\n\nFederation\n: Choose this option if the target application (SP) is affiliated with a federation service (e.g. InCommon, NJEdge etc.). Once you select \u201cFederation\u201d as the Metadata Type, another drop down menu called \u201cSelect Federation\u201d will appear. From this drop menu you can select the appropriate federation. After selecting the \u201cFederation Name\u201d, a new link called \u201cClick to select\nentity id\u201d will appear. Use this link to find and select the SP entityIDs that you wish to create SSO with. Learn how to establish trust with a federation \nbelow\n.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased\n: The SPs required attributes must be added to this panel. The required attributes can be selected from the menu on the left with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trust Relationship(TR) is added by clicking the \nAdd\n button located in the lower left side of the page.     \n\n\nRelying Party Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support SAML, the Relying Party software must be configured. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox \nConfigure specific Relying Party\n must be checked.     \n\n\n     \n\n\nThe checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to find information about configuring the relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.     \n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support a federation standard like SAML, and you or the developer are planning on adding federation to the application, we strongly recommend using OpenID Connect rather than SAML. OpenID Connect is newer, easier to use, and follows modern best practices. Learn more in our blog: \nOAuth vs. SAML vs. OpenID Connect\n.\n\n\n\n\nFederation Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the SP is part of an identity federation such as InCommon, the administrator must add the federation as an SP in the Gluu Server. This will enable the administrator to more easily create TRs with SPs in the federation. The example below shows how an administrator would add a TR for the InCommon Federation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce a TR has been established with the federation, the Gluu Server administrator can easily create TRs with any SP included in the federation by selecting the federation from the \nFederation Name\n drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP.\n\n\n\n\nInbound SAML (Asimba)\n#\n\n\nInbound SAML allows users from external domains to login at their home identity provider to gain access to resources protected by the Gluu Server. The Gluu Server uses an open source product called \nAsimba\n to normalize inbound SAML. \n\n\nThe following documentation provides a step-by-step guide for configuring Asimba with two (2) IDPs and a single (1) SP.

However, the last major release of SAML was in 2005! \nTherefore it is important to understand when to use SAML and when to use a \nnewer protocol like OpenID Connect to achieve your identity goals.   Refer to these four considerations to determine which protocol \nto use for single sign-on (SSO):   If you have an application that already supports SAML, use SAML.  If you need to support user login at an external IDP (like a customer or partner IDP), use SAML.  If you have a mobile application, use OpenID Connect.  If you are writing a new application, use OpenID Connect.   If you are continuing with the SAML documentation it is presumed your use case aligns with one or both of the first two bullet points above. If not, we recommend that you review the  OpenID Connect  portion of the Gluu Server docs.",

            "text": "There are two main SAML authentication workflows: outbound SAML and inbound SAML.   Outbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. \nIn an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) redirects a user to a \ndesignated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. \nThe IDP asks for the user's credentials and upon successful authentication redirects the user to the protected content.   Inbound SAML enables an organization to offer SAML authentication as a front door to their digital service. Inbound SAML is a common requirement for SaaS providers who need to support the authentication requirements of large enterprise customers.  The typical user flow for inbound SAML is as follows:    User tries to access your protected resource;      User is redirected to a discovery page (presented by your IDP) that presents one or more external IDP's that they may have existing credentials at (their \"home IDP\");     User selects their home IDP and is sent for authentication;     Upon successful authentication at their home IDP, user is redirected back to your service with access to the protected resource.    The Gluu Server bundles separate components to support both workflows (installation of each component is optional during Gluu Server deployment):    For outbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the Shibboleth SAML IDP.     For inbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the Asimba SAML Proxy.     Documentation for each service follows in the sections below.",

The Asimba metadata can be retrieved and downloaded from  https://test.gluu.org/asimba/profiles/saml2  While creating the Trust Relationship, choose  File  as the  Metadata Type  and upload the Asumba metadata.   Relying Party Configuration:  SAML2SSO  Profile      - example: \n    - includeAttributeStatement: Yes\n    - assertionLifeTime: 300000\n    - assertionProxyCount: 0\n    - signResponses: conditional\n    - signAssertions: never`\n    - signRequests: conditional\n    - encryptAssertions: never\n    - encryptNameIds: never   Attribute: Any attribute Service Providers require. Any kind of nameID from below list is mandatory.   nameID:   nameIDFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified\"  nameIDFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient\"  nameIDFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\"    How to create nameID in Gluu Server is available  here",

            "text": "Client Credentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials Grant allows resource owner to use password\ncredentials (i.e. username and password) as an authorization grant to\nobtain an access token. The credentials should only be used when there\nis a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client\n(e.g. its device operating system or a highly privileged application),\nand when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an\nauthorization code).\n\n\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the\nresource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for\na single request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client credentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Client Credentials Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThe Client Credentials flow should be used when the resources of or any\napplication/service are stored externally in cloud storages such as\nGoogle Storage or Amazon S3 which can be accessed using API. In this\ncase the application needs to read and update these resources, but\nacting on behalf of the app itself rather than any individual user.\nThe application can ask the OAuth authorization server for an access\ntoken directly, without the involvement of any end user.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Request\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execClientCredentialsGrant(scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\nint status response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken();\nTokenType tokenType response.getTokenType(); // bearer\n\n\n\n\nThe message sent to the authorization server is:\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials&scope=storage\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client.\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"c769d7ff-c476-42ab-b531-fe2f60b2f5cc\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3600}\n\n\n\n\nResource Owner Password Credentials Grant\n#\n\n\nThe resource owner password credentials (i.e. username and password) can\nbe used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token.\nThe credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust\nbetween the resource owner and the client (e.g. its device operating\nsystem or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization\ngrant types are not available (such as an authorization code).\n\n\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the\nresource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for\na single request and are exchanged for an access token. This grant type\ncan eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner\ncredentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a\nlong-lived access token or refresh token.\n\n\nThe flow is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\nThe steps of the flow are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser presents their credentials to the application in addition to a username and password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the client credentials are successfully authenticated, an access token is returned to the client\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Should the Resource Owner Password Flow Be Used?\n#\n\n\nThis flow should be used sparingly because the resource owner\u2019s password\nis exposed to the application. It is recommended only for first-party\n\u201cofficial\u201d applications released by the API provider, and not opened up\nto wider third-party developer communities. If a user is asked to type\ntheir password into \u201cofficial\u201d applications, they may become accustomed\nto doing so and become vulnerable to phishing attempts by other apps. In\norder to mitigate this concern, developers and IT administrators should\nclearly educate their users how they should determine which apps are\n\u201cofficial\u201d and which are not.\n\n\nSecurity Properties\n#\n\n\nThere are some security benefits to using this flow against\nauthenticating API calls with a username and password (via HTTP Basic\naccess authentication or similar) although the application has access to\nthe resource owner's password. With Basic authentication, an application\nneeds to have continuous access to the user\u2019s password in order to make\nAPI calls. If the user wants to revoke the access of the client, he must\nchange the password and re-enter the password in all the applications\nthat are allowed access to the resource.\n\n\nHowever, if the OAuth Resource Owner Password flow is used, the\napplication only needs access to the user\u2019s credentials once: on first\nuse when the credentials are exchanged for an access token. This means\nthere\u2019s no requirement for the app to store these credentials within the\napplication or on the device, and revoking access is easy as well.\n\n\nUser Experience\n#\n\n\nThe user experience for this flow is identical to typical password-based\naccess requests. The application asks the user for their username and\npassword and the user provides the information. The application then\nmakes either a server-side or client-side request to the API provider\u2019s\nauthorization server, without any user-facing interface changes. If the\nAPI provider does not issue a refresh_token and the issued access_token\nis short-lived, the application will likely store the username and\npassword for future authentication attempts. Unfortunately, this defeats\nsome of the benefit of this flow.\n\n\nExample Flow\n#\n\n\nThe following is an example showing the messages between the client and\nthe authorization server, also the example shows code fragments using\nthe oxAuth-Client.jar API to interact with the authorization server.\n\n\n// Parameters\nString tokenUrl = \"https://seed.gluu.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token\";\n\n// Call the service\nTokenClient tokenClient = new TokenClient(tokenUrl);\nTokenResponse response = tokenClient.execResourceOwnerPasswordCredentialsGrant(username, password, scope, clientId, clientSecret);\n\n// Handle response\nint status = response.getStatus(); // 200 if succeed\nString accessToken = response.getAccessToken(); // 26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\nTokenType tokenType = response.getTokenType(); // Enumeration: bearer\nString refreshToken = response.getRefreshToken(); // aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\nPOST /oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: seed.gluu.org\nAuthorization: Basic QCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5OjYyMTNlOWI5LWM0NmQtNDAwOC04YWYxLTAzZjkxOGE4YWRlNA==\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=password&scope=openid&username=mike&password=secret\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store, private\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\"access_token\":\"26d55e4b-6c61-40ea-9763-3282f5db0f0e\",\"token_type\":\"bearer\",\"expires_in\":3599,\"refresh_token\":\"aba91bd9-aa10-4fca-952b-50a9a9afac28\",\"scope\":\"openid\",\"id_token\":\"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2VlZC5nbHV1Lm9yZyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJtaWtlIiwiYXVkIjoiQCExMTExITAwMDghRkY4MSEyRDM5IiwiZXhwIjoxMzM5MTk2ODgxMzAzLCJveEludW0iOiJAITExMTEhMDAwMCFENEU3Iiwib3hWYWxpZGF0aW9uVVJJIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3NlZWQuZ2x1dS5vcmdcL294YXV0aFwvc2VhbVwvcmVzb3VyY2VcL3Jlc3R2MVwvb3hhdXRoXC9jaGVja19zZXNzaW9uIiwib3hPcGVuSURDb25uZWN0VmVyc2lvbiI6Im9wZW5pZGNvbm5lY3QtMS4wIn0.SzWfJsmlz62qTRw1lEJZ8PygY9eRupgmsbXLCQwPVDQ\"}\n\n\n\n\nGluu OAuth2 Access Management\n#\n\n\n[GAT][Gluu Access Token] is used for Gluu OAuth2 Access Management.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\n\nCentralized Access Management needs a profile enabling a client ot obtain a token from the AS by explicitly specifyting the \nrequested scopes.\n\n\nGluu Access Token\n#\n\n\nGAT as plain json\n#\n\n\n{\n    \"exp\": 1256953732,\n    \"iat\": 1256912345,\n    \"scopes\" : {\n       \"view\", \"manage\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe [GAT][Gluu Access Token] is issued at a new endpoint which is published at \n<hostname>/.well-known/uma-configuration\n\n\nImportant:\n all requests/response to/from/between RP, RS, AS must contain \"GAT\" HTTP header with \"true\" value.

For more information, \nsee \nhttp://openid.net/connect\n\n\nIt's handy to know some OpenID Connect jargon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nend user\n or \nsubject\n is the person being authenticated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Provider\n or \nOP\n is the equivalent of the SAML IDP. It \nholds the credentials (like a username/ password) and information about \nthe subject. The Gluu Server is an OP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelying Party\n or  \nRP\n is software, like a mobile application \nor website, which needs to authenticate the subject. The RP is an OAuth \nclient. \noxd\n is an RP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a good overview of OpenID Connect versus SAML, you should read\n\nthis blog\n. \n\n\nOpenID Connect in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server passes all \nOpenID Provider conformance profiles\n. \nIt supports the all the current specifications: Core, Dynamic Client \nRegistration, Discovery, Form Post Response Mode, Session Management, \nand the draft for Front Channel Logout.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Flows\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports all flows defined in the Core spec, including\nimplicit, code, and hybrid. The implicit flow, where the token and\nid_token are returned from the authorization endpoint, should only \nbe used for applications that run in the browser, like a Javascript \nclient. The code flow or hybrid flow should be used for server side\napplications, where code on the web server can more securely call\nthe token endpoint to obtain a token. The most useful response type \nfor the hybrid flow is \"code id_token\". Using this flow, you can verify\nthe integrity of the code by inspecting the \nc_hash\n claim in the \nid_token.\n\n\nIf you are using the code flow, the response type should only be code.\nThere is no point in using response type \"code token id_token\"--the extra\ntokens returned by the authorization endpoint will only create additional\ncalls to the LDAP server and slow you down. If you are going to trade\nthe code at the token endpoint for a new token and id_token, you don't\nneed them from the authorization endpoint too.\n\n\nConfiguration / Discovery\n#\n\n\nA good place to start when you're learning about OpenID Connect is\nthe configuration endpoint, which is located in the Gluu Server\nat the following URL: \nhttps://hostname/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\nThe Gluu Server also supports \nWebFinger\n,\nas specified in the OpenID Connect specification. You can test Webfinger\nusing the oxAuth-RP tool mentioned above. For more information, see \nthe [OpenID Connect Discovery Specification]\n(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)\n\n\nClient Registration / Configuration\n#\n\n\nOAuth clients need a client_id, and need to supply a login redirect uri--\nwhere the Authorization Server should redirect the end user to, post\nauthorization. The Gluu Server enables an administrator to manually create\na client via the oxTrust web interface. However, OpenID Connect also\ndefines a standard API where clients can register themselves--\n[Dynamic Client Registration]\n(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html). You can\nfind the registration URL by calling the configuration endpoint \n(\n/.well-known/openid-configuration\n). \n\n\nYou may not want clients to dynamically register themselves! To disable\nthis endpoint, in the oxAuth JSON properties, set the \n\ndynamicRegistrationEnabled\n value to False.\n\n\nIf you want to add a client through oxTrust, you can use the manual form:\nby click the \nAdd Client\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many client configuration parameters. Most of these are \nspecified in the OpenID Connect [Dynamic Client Registration]\n(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)specification.\nThere are two configurations params which can only be configured via \noxTrust by an administrator. These include:\n - Pre-Authorization -- Use this if you want to suppress the end user\n authorization prompt. This is handy for SSO scenarios where the clients\n are your own (not third party), and there is no need to prompt the \n person to approve the release of information.\n - Persist Client Authorizations -- Use this option if you only want \n to prompt the end user once to authorize the release of user \n information. It will cause the data to be persisted under the person's\n entry in the Gluu LDAP server.\n\n\nCustom Client Registration\n#\n\n\nUsing the Client Registration custom interception scripts,\nyou can implement post-registration business logic. You have access to \nthe data that the client used to register. You could validate data, \npopulate extra client claim, or modify the scope registrations. You\ncould even call API's to determine if you want to allow the \nregistration at all. To access the interface for custom scripts in \noxTrust, navigate to Configuration --> Custom Scripts --> Client Registration.\n\n\n\n\nThe script is \navailable here\n\n\nLogout\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession Management\n specification is still marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works. The current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session has been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the JavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another tab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some applications. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server also support the draft for \nFront Channel Logout\n. This\nis our recommended logout strategy. Using this mechanism, an html page is rendered which contains one iFrame for each application that \nneeds to be notified of a logout. The Gluu Server keeps track of which clients are associated with a session (i.e. your browser). This \nmechanism is not perfect. If the end user's web browser is blocking third party cookies, it may break front channel logout. Also, the Gluu Server has no record if the logout is successful--only the browser knows. This means that if the logout fails, it will not be logged or retried. The good thing about front channel logout is that the application can clear application cookies in the end user's browser. To use front channel logout, the client should register logout_uri's, or \nfrontchannel_logout_uri\n for clients using the Dynamic Client Registration API. \n\n\nScopes\n#\n\n\nIn OAuth, scopes are used to specify extents of access. For a sign-in \nflow like OpenID Connect, scopes end up corresponding to the release of\nuser claims. The Gluu Server supports the [standard scopes]\n(http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) defined \nin the OpenID Connect specification. You can also define your own scopes,\nand map them to any user attributes which you have registered. \n\n\n\n\nTo add more claims, simply click \"Add Claim\" and you will be presented\nwith the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n\n\nName of the scope which will be displayed when searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nText that will be displayed to the end user during approval of the scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Type\n\n\nOpenID, Dynamic or OAuth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Scope\n\n\nIf True, the scope may be requested during Dynamic Client Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Type \"OpenID\" specifies to the Gluu Server that this scope will\nbe used to map user claims; \"Dynamic\" specifies to the Gluu Server that\nthe scope values will be generated from the result of the Dynamic Scopes \ncustom interception script; \"OAuth\" specifies that the scope will have\nno claims, it will be meaningful to an external resource server. \n\n\nSpecifying a scope as \"Default\" means that a client can request it \nduring dynamic client registration. The only default scope is \nopenid\n, \nwhich is required by the OpenID Connect specification. You can always \nexplicitly release a scope to a certain client later on, but this will \nrequire some manual intervention by the Gluu Server admin.\n\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication for Clients\n#\n\n\nThe \nacr_values\n parameter is used to specify a specific \nworkflow for authentication. The value of this parameter, or the \n\ndefault_acr_values\n client metadata value, corresponds to the \n\"Name\" of a custom authentication script.\n\n\nOut-of-the-box supported \nacr\n values include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACR Value\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu2f\n\n\nFIDO U2F Device\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuper_gluu\n\n\nMulti-factor authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduo\n\n\nDuo soft-token authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncert\n\n\nSmart card or web browser X509 personal certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncas\n\n\nExternal CAS server\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncert\n\n\nSmart card or web browser X509 personal certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus\n\n\nGoogle+ authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTP\n\n\nOATH one time password\n\n\n\n\n\n\nasimba\n\n\nUse of the Asimba proxy for inbound SAML\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwilio_sms\n\n\nUse of the Twilio Saas to send SMS one time passwords\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassport\n\n\nUse of the Passport component for social login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyubicloud\n\n\nYubico cloud OTP verification service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuaf\n\n\nexperimental support for the FIDO UAF protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasic_lock\n\n\nEnables lockout after a certain number of failures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasic\n\n\nSample script using local LDAP authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenID Connect Client Software\n#\n\n\nAlthough you can use generic OAuth client libraries, you would have \nto write some extra code to take advantage of OpenID Connect's \nsecurity features. For example, there is no id_token in OAuth, so you \nwon't find any code for id_token validation in an OAuth library. A good \nOpenID Connect client will do much of the heavy lifting for you. \n\n\nJavaScript Client\n#\n\n\nA JavaScript client is one of the easiest ways to use OpenID Connect. \nGluu maintains a project called \nOpenID Implicit Client\n.\n\n\nYou'll have to add the client manually to the Gluu Server via the GUI. \nWhen completing the \nadd client\n form, you can use the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\nClient Name: Implicit Test Client\nresponse_type: token id_token\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nSubject Type: public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: token id_token\nGrant Types: implicit\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have registered the client in the Gluu Server, all you need to \ndo is update the \nclient_id\n, \nredirect_uri\n, and \nproviderInfo\n values \nin the login page html. Assuming you've checked out the project into a \nweb accessible folder, then navigate to the page and test! \n\n\nServer-Side libraries\n#\n\n\nMany applications are \"server-side\", meaning the web page displays \ncontent but most of the dynamic business logic resides on the web server. \nThe OpenID Foundation maintains a list of client libraries on \n\ntheir website\n. However, our \nexperience has been that the quality of these libraries varies widely. \nSome are not well documented, other are not updated frequently, and some \ndo not implement essential security features available in OpenID Connect. \nIn addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes \ndifficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, \nwe recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called \n\noxd\n.  \n\n\noxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per \nday per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on \n\nGitHub\n, and there are free \nopen source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, \nRuby, Perl and Go. There are also plugins available for several popular \nopen source applications.\n\n\nWatch the oxd demo\n.\n\n\nGet an oxd license for free\n\n\nWeb Server Plugins\n#\n\n\nA popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server \nfilter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that \nconnection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter \nmay directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. \nLeveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older \naccess management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager. \n\n\nOne of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the \napplication developer does not need to know that much about the \nsecurity protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, \nthe person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another \nadvantage is that the application security is administered by the system \nadministrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to \nmanage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code. \n\n\nOne of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written \nby Hans Zandbelt, called \nmod_auth_openidc\n. It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source. \n\n\nNote: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar \n\nLua implementation\n \nto make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS. \n\n\nAppAuth for Mobile Applications\n#\n\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Connect is to authenticate \npeople from a mobile application. The IETF draft \n\nOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\n \nprovides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In \naddition to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests \nthe use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can \nregister a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).\n\n\nIn 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation \ncalled AppAuth for \nAndroid\n \nand \niOS\n. The AppAuth projects \nalso include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that \nit was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app \ndevelopers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only \ndoes AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the \nsystem browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by \nleveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser \nto be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable \nan app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications \nto steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can \nuse the authorization code or hybrid flow (as described earlier). \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is the only free open source OpenID Connect Provider \nthat currently supports AppAuth. \n\n\noxAuth RP\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server ships with an optional OpenID Connect RP web application, \nwhich is handy for testing.  It's called oxauth-rp. During Gluu Server \nsetup, you'll be asked if you want to install it--which you should on \na development environment. It will be deployed on \nhttps://<hostname>/oxauth-rp\n. \nUsing this tool you can exercise all of the OpenID Connect API's, \nincluding discovery, client registration, authorization, token, \nuserinfo, and end_session.",

            "text": "A popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server \nfilter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that \nconnection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter \nmay directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. \nLeveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older \naccess management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager.   One of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the \napplication developer does not need to know that much about the \nsecurity protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, \nthe person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another \nadvantage is that the application security is administered by the system \nadministrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to \nmanage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code.   One of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written \nby Hans Zandbelt, called  mod_auth_openidc . It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source.   Note: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar  Lua implementation  \nto make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS.",

The IETF draft  OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps  \nprovides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In \naddition to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests \nthe use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can \nregister a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).  In 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation \ncalled AppAuth for  Android  \nand  iOS . The AppAuth projects \nalso include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that \nit was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app \ndevelopers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only \ndoes AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the \nsystem browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by \nleveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser \nto be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable \nan app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications \nto steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can \nuse the authorization code or hybrid flow (as described earlier).

It uses \nSCIM-Client\n, \na Java library also developed by Gluu intended for client applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Maven, below is how to add SCIM-Client to your project:\n\n\n\n\n<repositories>\n  <repository>\n    <id>gluu</id>\n    <name>Gluu repository</name>\n    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>\n  </repository>\n</repositories>\n...\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>\n  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>\n  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with Release v2.4.2, an SCIM-Client must be used on a matching Gluu CE. For example, if you are running CE v2.4.4, you must also use SCIM-Client v2.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your domain's SSL certificate to the JRE's \ncacerts\n certificate key store where your client application will run. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply the UMA parameters and run the code. \nNOTE:\n If you have re-installed Gluu CE, please note that the UMA parameters / JWKS files are also regenerated. You must then rebuild your client code with \ntarget\n or \ntmp\n folders possibly cleared beforehand to avoid conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage gluu.scim.client.dev.local;\n\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimClient;\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimResponse;\nimport gluu.scim2.client.Scim2Client;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\nimport javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;\n\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonGenerationException;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingException;\n\npublic class TestScimClient {\n\n    private static void testScim1Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final ScimClient scimClient = ScimClient.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        ScimResponse response = scimClient.personSearch(\"uid\", \"admin\", MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM1 \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    private static void testScim2Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final Scim2Client scim2Client = Scim2Client.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        String filter = \"userName eq \\\"admin\\\"\";\n        ScimResponse response = scim2Client.searchUsers(filter, 1, 1, \"\", \"\", null);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM2: \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, JAXBException {\n\n        final String domain = \"https://c67.gluu.info/identity/seam/resource/restv1\";\n        final String umaMetaDataUrl = \"https://c67.gluu.info/.well-known/uma-configuration\";\n        final String umaAatClientId = \"@!A410.188A.95DD.EA5A!0001!3A1E.BAA5!0008!5870.A795\";\n\n        final String umaAatClientJksPath = \"D:\\\\Development\\\\test_data\\\\scim\\\\scim-rp.jks\";\n        final String umaAatClientJksPassword = \"secret\";\n        final String umaAatClientKeyId = \"\";\n\n        testScim1Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n        testScim2Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 Test Mode (v2.4.4+)\n#\n\n\nStarting with CE v2.4.4, the \"test mode\" configuration will help developers test the SCIM 2.0 endpoints easier. Instead of UMA + SCIM-Client, in test mode a long-lived OAuth2 access token issued by the Gluu server is used to authorize with the SCIM 2.0 endpoints.\n\n\nTo enable test mode, do the following:\n\n\n\n\nLogin to the oxTrust GUI  \n\n\nNavigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nJSON Configuration\n > \nOxTrust Configuration\n, \nthen locate the property \nscimTestMode\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet it to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nclick the \nSave Configuration\n button. \nThe Gluu server will then create a long-lived OAuth2 access token with a \nvalidity period of one year. Doing this will also switch the authentication \nscheme from UMA to OAuth2 Access Token.\n\n\nClick on  \nJSON Configuration\n > \nOxTrust Configuration\n in the left navigation pane. \nThis will retrieve the access token and be displayed in the \nscimTestModeAccessToken\n property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the access token has expired, just repeat the previous steps to create a new one.\n\n\n\n\nThe access token can then be used as the query string \nparameter \naccess_token\n in accessing the SCIM 2.0 endpoints, for example:\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify the current authentication scheme of the SCIM 2.0 \nendpoints by browsing its \nServiceProviderConfig\n:\n\n\n\n\nTo exit test mode, just set \nscimTestMode\n back to \nfalse\n then \n* click the \nSave Configuration\n button. This will switch the \nauthentication scheme from OAuth2 Access Token to UMA. If you try using \nyour access token again, you will now get the \n403 Unauthorized\n error:\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n#\n\n\nUMA is protected with SCIM in Gluu Server Community Edition (CE). \nThe usage of UMA requires HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests.

Add your domain's SSL certificate to the JRE's  cacerts  certificate key store where your client application will run. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to do this.    Supply the UMA parameters and run the code.  NOTE:  If you have re-installed Gluu CE, please note that the UMA parameters / JWKS files are also regenerated.

To enable test mode, do the following:   Login to the oxTrust GUI    Navigate to  Configuration  >  JSON Configuration  >  OxTrust Configuration , \nthen locate the property  scimTestMode .     Set it to  true .  click the  Save Configuration  button. \nThe Gluu server will then create a long-lived OAuth2 access token with a \nvalidity period of one year.

If the access token has expired, just repeat the previous steps to create a new one.   The access token can then be used as the query string \nparameter  access_token  in accessing the SCIM 2.0 endpoints, for example:   You can verify the current authentication scheme of the SCIM 2.0 \nendpoints by browsing its  ServiceProviderConfig :   To exit test mode, just set  scimTestMode  back to  false  then \n* click the  Save Configuration  button.

Point your browser at \nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\nYou should see a list of current environment variables. \n\n\nConfiguration of mod_auth_openidc\n#\n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nmod_auth_openidc\n module depends on the Ubuntu package \nlibjansson4\n: \n\n\n# apt-get install libjansson\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need the mod_auth_openidc and libjose packages which can \nbe downloaded from the \nReleases Page\n.\n\n\nFor example, at this time the current release is 2.1.3, so the command would be:\n\n\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGet the latest packages here: https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases\n\n\n\n\nNote, if you like to build from source, you can clone the project at \nGithub Page\n\n\nNow you can enable the module\n\n\n# sudo a2enmod auth_openidc\n# sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods for client registration:\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Client Registration\n\n\nManual Client Registration\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, let's create the client manually in the Gluu Server.\nWhen you add the client, use the following parameters:\n\n\nName: mod_auth_openidc\nClient Secret: something-sufficiently-unguessable\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nlogin uri: https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nSubject Type: Public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: code\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a note of the \nclient_secret\n (you won't get to see it again)! You'll\nalso need the \nclient_id\n for the next step.\n\n\nInstall CGI script\n#\n\n\nThis cgi-script makes for a good test page! \n\n\n# vi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nThen paste in this code\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport os\n\nd = os.environ\nk = d.keys()\nk.sort()\n\nprint \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\"\n\nprint \"<HTML><Head><TITLE>Print Env Variables</TITLE></Head><BODY>\"\nprint \"<h1>Environment Variables</H1>\"\nfor item in k:\n    print \"<p><B>%s</B>: %s </p>\" % (item, d[item])\nprint \"</BODY></HTML>\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you'll need to make the script executable by the Apache2\n\n\n# chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n# chmod ug+x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Apache VirtualHost\n#\n\n\nYou are almost done! You'll need to configure mod_auth_openidc to\nprotect your server.\n\n\n# vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following right under \n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n\n\nOIDCProviderMetadataURL https://idp.mydomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\nOIDCClientID (client-id-you-got-back-when-you-added-the-client)\nOIDCClientSecret (your-client-secret)\nOIDCRedirectURI https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nOIDCResponseType code\nOIDCScope \"openid profile email\"\nOIDCSSLValidateServer Off\nOIDCCryptoPassphrase (a-random-seed-value)\nOIDCPassClaimsAs environment\nOIDCClaimPrefix USERINFO_\nOIDCPassIDTokenAs payload\n<Location \"/\">\n    Require valid-user\n    AuthType openid-connect\n</Location>\n\n\n\n\n\nThen restart Apache to effect the changes\n\n\n# service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most confusing part here is the \nOIDCRedirectURI\n--don't set this\nto a path used by your server. The apache-filter uses the redirect_uri \nto process the response from the OpenID Provider (Gluu Server). \n\n\nNow you're ready to test. Open your web browser, and point it at \n\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n \n\n\nIf you're not logged in already, you should be redirected to \nthe authentication page. If you are logged in, you should just see\nan html page with the \nREMOTE_USER\n variable populated. Also\ncheck out the \nOIDC_id_token_payload\n and all the claims for \n\nUSERINFO_\n \n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nWe assume that all the hostnames will be dns resolvable. If not, then\nadd the according entries in \n/etc/hosts\n, please.\n\n\nAdd EPEL Repository\n#\n\n\nRun the following command to \nAdd EPEL Repo\n.\n\n\n\n\n# rpm -ivh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm\n\n\n\n\nApache Web Server\n#\n\n\nTo setup \nApache2 SSL\n, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the hiredis package is not found by the \nyum\n command, please download it manually from \nthis page\n and install it.\n\n\n\n\n# yum install httpd mod_ssl\n# yum install curl hiredis jansson\n\n\n\n\nConfigure SSL Module\n#\n\n\nThis section will guide you to create SSL certificates.\nUse the following commands to crete a  directory and generate the certificates.\n\n\n# mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl\n# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem -keyout /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter some values such as company name, country etc. Please enter them and your certificate will be ready. A template is given below\n\n\n    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US\n    State or Province Name (full name) []:TX\n    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Austin\n    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Gluu\n    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n    Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:modauth-centos.info\n    Email Address []:support@gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to configure Apache to use the certificates and use the following command to edit the \nssl.conf\n file. \n\n\n# vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\nThe important part of the configuration is to enter the path to the created SSL certificates. The example is given below.\n\n\nNote:\n Please make sure to use the correct server name in the configuration file.\n\n\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n    ServerAdmin support@gluu.org\n    ServerName gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nRestart Apache Server and you are done configuring the SSL Module.

Open your web browser, and point it at\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi`\n\n\noxRay\n#\n\n\nLifeRay\n OpenID Connect plugin to authenticate users using\nGluu IdP.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nThe oxAuth LifeRay plugin is used to authenticate and auto-log users\nfrom Gluu Server into \nLifeRay\n with the same credentials. It\nis built on top of oxAuth, the OpenID Connect provider by Gluu.\n\n\nThe oxAuth plugin intercepts any attempt to login from anywhere in the\nLifeRay and redirects the request and the user to an oxAuth server where\nthe identification takes place, actually. If the user has authorized the\nserver to share some of his basic information with the oxAuth plugin,\nthe user will be redirected back to the LifeRay CMS, and logged in,\nautomatically.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to use the LifeRay CMS as the basis for an\norganizational personal data store service.\n\n\nNote: This plugin does not support auto-user creation from information\nsupplied by the oxAuth Plugin. Instead, it can be implemented by\nextending the plugin.\n\n\nDeployment\n#\n\n\nThe plugin is provided in two variants--\nMaven\n and \nAnt\n.\nYou can either use Maven or the LifeRay plugin SDK to build and deploy\nthis plugin as a standard LifeRay hot deployable WAR file.\n\n\nDeploying WAR file using Maven\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: make sure that you have \nMaven\n\ninstalled on your system to build this plugin from source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the Maven source from the [oxRay Repository][https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxRay/tree/master/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the file \npom.xml\n in \ngluu-openid-connect-hook\n, and update\nyour local LifeRay Tomcat bundle path. This is required for building the\nWAR file and deploying to the LifeRay Tomcat bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the \ngluu/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n \ndirectory:\n\n\n\n\nmvn clean install package liferay:deploy\n\n\n\n\nThis will take a few seconds to download the dependency \njar\n files, and\ngenerate the LifeRay-compiled deployable WAR file. It will be placed\nwithin your \n<liferay-bundle-folder>/deploy\n directory, and the hot\ndeployable process will start.\n\n\nUsing LifeRay Plugin SDK With Ant\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: we assume that you have the plugin SDK\nboth installed and configured with LifeRay bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the gluu-openid-connect-hook plugin source from the\nrepository, and place these files in your local directory for the plugin\nSDK. Usually, this is \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the folder \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nant clean deploy\n\n\n\n\nUsing Binary From Repository\n#\n\n\nYou can also download a compiled binary as a standard LifeRay deployable\nWAR file from the following location:\n\n\noxRay LifeRay Deployable War File\n\n\nCopy this WAR file in your LifeRay bundle. Usually, this is located at\n\nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1/deploy\n.\n\n\nOnce the plugin is deployed as a WAR file either using Maven or Ant, you\nwill see the following success message in your LifeRay Tomcat server:\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nA LifeRay application needs to be registered with the Authorization\nserver before initiating an authentication request/response with OAuth\nIdP server.\n\n\nThe following steps are necessary to obtain both a client id and a\nclient secret. These data will be used within the LifeRay portal\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the location \nhttps://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp/home.seam\n.\n\n\nYou will see the Dynamic Client Registration Section.\n\n\nEnter the Registration Endpoint uri, for example\n\nhttps://idp.example.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize\n.\n\n\nYou can derive this uri from your IdP auto-discovery uri which is\nlike that: \nhttps://<Your IDP Server Domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nYou can search for the registration endpoint, and copy that uri here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the redirect uris as \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n:\n\n\nReplace your domain name with \nlocalhost:8080\n\n\nThis will be your LifeRay handler for logging a user into LifeRay,\nautomatically, when a redirect comes back from the OAuth server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Response Types: CODE\n\n\nSelect the Application Type: WEB\n\n\nFor development purposes use: NATIVE (if you are testing on a local\nmachine with \nlocalhost:8080\n domain)\n\n\nEnter Client Name: LifeRay App (you can choose any name here).\n\n\nAll other options can be left as they are--please see the attached\nscreenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n, and both the following \nRegistration Request\n and\n\nRegistration Response\n will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Registration Response to your local system. The parameters\n\nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n are used in LifeRay when configuring\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\n\n\nModifying portal.properties\n#\n\n\nIt is necessary to modify \nportal-ext.properties\n file to reflect oxAuth\nserver client credentials and server's URL. It can be accomplished by\nnavigating into the \nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1\n folder, where the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n is stored.\n\n\nNote: To either activate or deactivate the oxAuth plugin put the value\n\ntrue\n (to activate) or \nfalse\n (to deactivate), respectively.\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.auth.enabled=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxAuth client ID and client secret:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.id=@!1111!0008!51CE.1E59\ngluu.openidconnect.client.secret=65777eb7-87a8-4d60-9dbc-d31d43971f2b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server domain\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.domain=https://idp.gluu.org`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server auto discovery uri\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.url.discovery=https://idp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour OAuth server logout uri (typically, this will be used to logout a\nuser from OAuth when a user logs out from LifeRay)\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.logout=https://idp.gluu.org/identity/logout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeRay server callback uri that will be used as a handling response\nby the OAuth server after authentication:\n\n\nreplace the \nlocalhost:8080\n with your LifeRay domain name:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n\n\n\n\n This page will be invoked when the user does not exist in the\n LifeRay database, but gets authenticated from the OAuth Server.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, create a LifeRay page with the name \n/no-such-user-found\n,\n  or redirect to the LifeRay registration page uri like that:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.no.such.user.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/no-such-user-found\n\n\n\n\nRestart the LifeRay server after editing the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\nLogin Using the LifeRay Front End\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer Bootup\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay server is restarted, open your browser and\n  navigate to the uri \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin uri\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay page successfully loaded navigate to the OpenID\n  connect page at \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: you can edit the theme code, and link to the login uri as\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n. In result the user will\nalways redirect to the OAuth server for authentication.\n\n\n\n\nOAuth authentication\n\n\nThe LifeRay login uri will redirect users to the OAuth IdP server\n  for user authentication. Internally, passing the oAuth client id \n  as the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest for permission\n\n\nThis screen can be configured depending upon your OAuth Server\n  implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth callback (user auto-login to LifeRay)\n\n\nAfter a successful authentication with the OAuth server, IdP will\nsend a callback to LifeRay with a specific code as a parameter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback?code=xxx`\n\n\n\n\nThis will be intercepted by our oxAuth LifeRay plugin. Upon validation\nof the token with the Gluu IdP, it will result in a login of the user to\nthe LifeRay. The user will be redirected to his respective start page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect to authenticate a person in Java\n#\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Connect\n Protocol offers Java\ndevelopers a way to authenticate a person at any Internet domain that\nsupports the standard. To accomplish this, the domain must provide a way\nto register clients--the website and mobile applications that use the\nauthentication API offered by the domain.\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nDiscovery is the first step! Luckily, its super-easy! All you have to \ndo is make a get request to\n\nhttps://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nThis will return a JSON object, as described in the\n\nspecification\n.\nFor example, you can see Gluu's OpenID Connect discovery\n\nurl\n.\n\n\nThis will tell you everything you need to know about this OpenID Connect\nprovider, like what are the endpoints (URLs), what crypto is supported,\nand what user claims can you ask for.\n\n\nAn \nexample\n\nof a Discovery Request, using the oxAuth RP library.\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nIn SAML, the website was called a \"Service Provider.\" In OpenID Connect,\nthe website (or mobile application) is called a \"Client\". Clients can be\nregistered manually by the OP, but more frequently, clients use the\n\nDynamic Registration\nAPI\n to\nautomate the process.\n\n\nObtaining the id_token\n#\n\n\nAfter your client is registered, it is time to get down to business.\nOpenID Connect offers two common workflows for authentication: basic\n(where the person is using a browser, and can be re-directed) and\nimplicit where the client sends the credentials, including the secret.\nThere is a useful implements guide for\n\nbasic\n and\n\nimplicit\n.\n\n\nLogout\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect defines a mechanism for \nSession\nManagement\n.\nThe idea is that JavaScript in a web tab can detect that another tab has\nlogged out. One detection of a logout event, the Web application can\ncleanup sessions in any backend systems as necessary. It is not 100%\neffective. If the tab is closed when the logout occurs in another tab,\nthe event may not be detected, and the backend systems are advised to\ntimeout sessions.\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect from JavaScript\n#\n\n\nSee \nOpenID Connect plugin for Passport\n for further details.",

The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntos_uri\n\n\nURL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks_uri\n\n\nURL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code\n\n        \nReason\n\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400\n\n            \ninvalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

One of these registered Redirection URI values must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request    response_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 response_type values that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token    grant_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are: authorization_code  The Authorization Code Grant Type implicit  The Implicit Grant Type refresh_token  The Refresh Token Grant Type The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list: code: authorization_code id_token: implicit token id_token: implicit code id_token: authorization_code, implicit code token: authorization_code, implicit code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit    application_type  Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.    contacts  e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.    client_name  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.    logo_uri  URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.    client_uri  URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.",

SCIM uses a REST API for operations which are disabled by default. The support for SCIM must be enabled from the oxTrust admin interface. \nSCIM is enabled from the Organization Configuration in the oxTrust administration interface. Please navigate to \nOrganization Configuration\n --> \nSystem Configuration\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlease navigate down the page to find \nSCIM Support\n in the \nSYstem Configuration\n page and select \nEnabled\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Endpoints\n#\n\n\nSCIM uses REST API for the operations which are covered in short in this section. There are two versions of the SCIM API each with its own specification. This usage of SCIM requires advanced level knowledge of HTTP GET and POST commands and not recommended for entry level users.\n\n\nThe SCIM 1.1 is governed by the \nSCIM:Protocol 1.1\n document and SCIM 2.0 is governed by the \nSCIM:Core Schema\n & \nSCIM:Protocol\n. As it is mentioned before, the specifications define an API, the operations are performed through endpoints. There are three endpoints that are available in Gluu Server SCIM:\n\n\n\n\nUser Endpoint\n\n\nGroup Endpoint\n\n\nBulk Operation Endpoint\n\n\n\n\nThe supported operations are given later in this document.\n\n\nSCIM 1.1\n#\n\n\nThe endpoints URLS are incomplete withour the hostname.

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.\n\n\nIf the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.\n\n\nIn circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

An RPT is associated\nwith a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is\nauthorized for access. \n\n\nThe token's nature and format are dictated by its profile. The profile\nmight allow it to be self-contained, such that the resource server is\nable to determine its status locally, or might require or allow the\nresource server to make a run-time introspection request of the\nauthorization server that issued the token.\n\n\nThe endpoint MAY allow other parameters to provide further context to\nthe query. For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.\n\n\nTo prevent unauthorized token scanning attacks, the endpoint MUST also\nrequire some form of authorization to access this endpoint, such as\nclient authentication as described in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] or a separate\nOAuth 2.0 access token such as the bearer token described in OAuth 2.0\nBearer Token Usage [RFC6750].

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant.

For instance, an authorization service may need to know the\nIP address of the client accessing the protected resource in order to\ndetermine the appropriateness of the token being presented.

The hostname and the IP address is used in many settings stored \nin LDAP configuration entries, Apache/Tomcat configuration and into the custom authentication script.\nIt is strongly recommended to use a fresh install in a new VM. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use static IP address with reverse proxy or load balancer or simple port forwarding.\n\n\n\n\nHow to set the port to something other than 443\n#\n\n\nPorts other than 443 are not supported as the port is used by Apache Web Server. In theory, the change must reflect in the SAML and OpenID Connect metadata and still there might be errors.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease use a virtual ethernet interface and a different IP address on your server\n\n\n\n\nHow to customize IDP to ask for Email instead of username\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust navigate to the Manage Authentication tab within the Configuration section. By default the Primary Key and Local Key are set to \nuid\n. Set those va    lues to \nmail\n and now your Gluu Server will expect email as the identifier instead of username.\n\n\n\n\nNow you will want to update your IDP login page to display \nEmail Address\n as the requested identifier. In order to do that you need to modify the \nlogin.xhtm    l\n file, which is located in \n/opt/tomcat/webapps/oxauth/\n. Insert \nEmail Address\n as the value for \noutputLabel\n; this snippet is under the \ndialog\n class. S    ee the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nHow to add additional roles to oxTrust and change permissions for existing ones\n#\n\n\nThe additional role requires the implementation of dynamic rules in Jboss SEAM and then uitlize them in oxTrust as the available \nmanager\n and \nuser\n roles are defined within the \nsecurit.drl\n hard-coded into oxTrust. The file checks for the \nmaanger\n group membership and adds the role to the web context. This is currently out of the scope of support. \n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\noxTrust is a tool for administrators and it must nto be used as a user facing application.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Guide\n#\n\n\nAdd admin for Gluu server\n#\n\n\nPlease follow these steps to restore your Gluu admin account (you will\nprobably need to substitute actual port, bind names and hostnames with\nones used by your installation):\n\n\n1) Login into Gluu's chroot environment with the command below:\n\n\n# service gluu-server login\n\n\n\n\n2) Run this command:\n\n\n#/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu gluuGroupType=gluuManagerGroup 1.1\n\n\n\n\nand remember the displayed dn of the Gluu Manager Group for future use.\n\n\n3) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -b o=gluu ou=people 1.1\n\n\n\n\nand remember the displayed dn of the People ou for future use.\n\n\n4) While staying in the chrooted environment, create the file\n\n~/add_user.ldif\n using your favorite text editor, and copy the\nfollowing lines to it:\n\n\ndn: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87,o=gluu\nchangetype: add\nuid: tempadmin\nobjectClass: gluuPerson\nobjectClass: top\ngivenName: tempadmin\nsn: tempadmin\ninum: tempadmin\ngluuStatus: active\nuserPassword: 1q2w3e\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the string's segment marked with bold: you will have to\nsubstitute it with dn of your own People ou which you've acquired in\nstep 3).\n\n\n5) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_user.ldif\n\n\n\n\nThis will create new user tempadmin with attributes provided via file\ncreated in step 4).\n\n\n6) Now create file \nadd_2_group.ldif\n in your home (\"~/\") directory and\ncopy the following lines to it:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!F9CC.D762.4778.1032!0001!2C72.BB87!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=tempadmin,ou=people,o=@!f9cc.d762.4778.1032!0001!2c72.bb87,o=gluu\n\n\n\n\nAgain, please note the strings' segment marked with bold: you will have\nto substitute contents of the \"dn:\" string with dn of your own Gluu\nManager Group which you've acquired in step 2), and for \"member:\" string\nyou will have to use the dn of tempadmin user (the one you already\nspecified in the 1st line of the file in step 4).\n\n\n7) Run this command:\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/add_2_group.ldif\n\n\n\n\nThis will add tempadmin user to the IdP managers group and you can then\nlogin and assign another user to act as admin.\n\n\nConnectivity Issues?\n#\n\n\nDNS names not resolving!\n#\n\n\nIt is possible that even after configuring everything there is a \nDNS\n resolve error in Gluu Server.\nThe reason is the \nDNS\n used inside the chroot container; the \ndns\n used by the container is the Google DNS servers \nand the \nDNS\n for the host OS is not used.

Ubuntu-based container's environment will be used for all command examples, if not stated otherwise explicitly. Commands may differ slightly for other distro families.\n\n\nBefore you start changing anything\n#\n\n\nBackup all your current certificates, keys and java key storages that may be affected:\n\n\n\n\nLog into your instance: \n# service gluu-server-2.4.3 login\n\n(if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4 you should update to current version)\n\n\nBackup everything under \n/etc/certs/\n directory, then also backup your container's default java key storage (\ncacerts\n file); it can be located under \n/etc/ssl/certs/java/\n for Ubuntu- and Debian-based container, and under \n/etc/pki/java/\n for CentOS- and RHEL-based containers. It also usually has symbolic link insalled for it, which is the same for both families: \n/usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts\n\n\n\n\nNote: In order to have the new cert used for anything in oxtrust, i.e. anything hitting \n/identity\n and \n/oxauth\n, you only need to follow the instructions for \nupdating the Apache web server\n.\n\n\nDefault JVM Keystore\n#\n\n\nJava programs making SSL connections to an external server may use the default JVM truststore, \n/usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts\n, to establish trust for certificates they are presented with. During installation, \nsetup.py\n generates self-signed certificates for all components and adds them to the \ncacerts\n truststore.\n\n\nApache Web Server Certificate Update Process\n#\n\n\nThis is a common task. Before you launch your production Gluu Server, you may want to install a certificate from a well known certification authority like Verisign or Godaddy. Also, Web SSL certificates usually expire each year. To import it into Gluu CE:\n\n\n\n\nLog into your instance: \n# service gluu-server-2.4.3 login\n\n    (if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4.x you should update to current version)\n\n\nCreate a file containing full set of all intermediary CA certificates and root certificates for the commercial CA which issued your Web SSL certificate. You can name the file whatever you want, but place it under \n/etc/certs\n. The file should contain intermediate certificate(s), followed by the root CA'a certificate. \n For more info see doc page about the \nSSLCertificateChainFile directive\n\n\nPut your new commercial certificate in PEM format in one file, and the private key you used to generate the CSR for this certificate in the other file under \n/etc/certs/\n; make sure your private key isn't password protected.\n\n\nVerify that user under which your Apache process runs has read permissions to all three files: certificate chain, server ssl certificate, key.\n\n\nUpdate \nSSLCertificateFile\n, \nSSLCertificateKeyFil\n and \nSSLCertificateChainFile\n directives in Gluu's Apcache configuration file so they point to the files you've added; in Ubuntu you can find the configuration in \n/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/https_gluu.conf\n. For Centos and RedHat, it is located in \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/https_gluu.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow its time to update the default keystore of your JVM:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a copy of your commercial certificate encoded in DER format: \n# openssl x509 -in pem-formatted-cert.crt -outform der -out der-formatted-cert.der\n\n\nFind out the exact alias name of your current (self-signed) Apache certificate in the cacerts file: \n# keytool -list -v -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | grep -i '_httpd'\n It should have an alias of sort \u201cyour-instance-hostname_httpd\u201d\n\n\nRemove your old certificate from the store: \n# keytool -delete -alias your-instance-hostname_httpd -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts \\\n-storepass changeit\n\n\nImport the new one with the same alias: \n# keytool -import -alias your-instance-hostname_httpd --trustcacerts -file /etc/certs/der-formatted-cert.der \\\n-keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit\n\n\nRestart Tomcat service: \n# /etc/init.d/tomcat restart\n\n\nRestart Apache service: \n# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\nHow to test\n#\n\n\nYou have next options:\n\n\n\n\nChecking how certificate chain is visualized and its healthiness is evaluated by your browser. For example, correctly configured certificate chain may look like this in Firefox: \n\n\nYou could use one of online validation tools, like the Qualys\u00ae SSL Labs' SSL Server Test\n\n\nUsing console tools, like connecting to the SSL/TLS enabled port your Gluu's Apache listens on (443 by default) with \n# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <host>:<port>\n. It will display the whole certificate chain sent by the web server together with secure overlay's parameters which were negotiated during SSL/TLS handshake.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating certificate used by Shibboleth module (idp.war)\n#\n\n\nShibboleth has it's own java keystore protected by a password that is unique to each instance. Due to this just copying previous Shibboleth keystore file is not the easiest way to proceed, as you would need to find all possible places in configuration files from which it's being referenced and update all settings in them mentioning that password. It's better to recreate this keystore using key pair imported from your previous instance and password which the new instance uses, with the same console commands \nsetup.py\n script employs. To properly install your previous Shibboleth certificate:\n\n\n\n\nLog into the your new instance: \n# service gluu-server-2.4.3 login\n (if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4.x you should update to current version)\n\n\nCopy your Shibboleth's secret key (in non-encrypted form) and certificate in PEM format into \n/etc/certs\n directory, overwriting corresponding files there. In Gluu CE 2.4.x these files are named \nshibIDP.key\n and \nshibIDP.crt\n, respectively.\n\n\nAcquire Shibboleth's keystore's password this instance uses. One option is to get it from the \nsetup.properties.last\n file: \n# cat /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last | grep -i 'shibJksPass'\n\n\nMerge together certificate and key files into PKCS12 archive: \n# openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey /etc/certs/shibIDP.key -in /etc/certs/shibIDP.crt -out /etc/certs/shibIDP.pkcs12 \\\n-passout pass:YOUR_SHIB_KEYSTORE_PASS -name your-instance-hostname\n\n\nTransform your PKCS12 archive into new instance's Shibboleth's java keystore file (this command will overwrite your privous keystore in \n/etc/certs\n): \n# keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /etc/certs/shibIDP.pkcs12 -srcstorepass YOUR_SHIB_KEYSTORE_PASS \\\n-srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore /etc/certs/shibIDP.jks -deststoretype JKS -deststorepass YOUR_SHIB_KEYSTORE_PASS \\\n-keyalg RSA -noprompt\n\n\nVerify that user \u201ctomcat\u201d has read access to all 4 files mentioned (shibIDP.key, shibIDP.crt, shibIDP.pkcs12 and shibIDP.jks)\n\n\nCreate a copy of your Shibboleth certificate encoded in DER format: \n# openssl x509 -in /etc/certs/shibIDP.crt -outform der -out /etc/certs/shibIDP.der\n\n\nFind out the exact alias name of your current Shibboleth's certificate in the \ncacerts\n file: \n# keytool -list -v -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | grep -i '_shibidp'\n. It should have an alias of sort \u201cyour-instance-hostname_shibidp\u201d\n\n\nRemove your old certificate from the store: \n# keytool -delete -alias your-instance-hostname_shibidp -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts \\\n-storepass changeit\n\n\nImport the new one with the same alias: \n# keytool -import -alias your-instance-hostname_shibidp --trustcacerts -file /etc/certs/shibIDP.der \\\n-keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit\n\n\nRestart Tomcat service: \n# /etc/init.d/tomcat restart\n\n\nRestart Apache service: \n# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\nHow to test\n#\n\n\nAfter Tomcat's restart Shibboleth's configuration generated from a set of Velocity templates should be updated to include your changes to it. One way to test they have been applied is to check the current certificate the module includes in its SAML metadata that is shown at url like \nhttps://your-instance-hostname/idp/shibboleth\n, or can be found in the file \n/opt/idp/metadata/YOUR-ORG-INUM-idp-metadata.xml\n - it should show the same certificate you tried to import following steps above. If it does not, try to wait until Tomcat has fully started and restart it one more time. Please also pay attention to any error messages appearing in \n/opt/idp/logs/idp-process.log\n during Tomcat's startup.\n\n\nUpdating certificate used by Asimba module (asimba.war)\n#\n\n\nThis procedure is quite similar to updating Shibboleth's certificate: \n\n\n\n\nLog into your instance: \n# service gluu-server-2.4.3 login\n (if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4 you should update to current version)\n\n\nCopy your Asimba's secret key (in non-encrypted form) and certificate in PEM format into \n/etc/certs\n directory, overwriting corresponding files there. In Gluu CE 2.4.x these files are named \nasimba.key\n and \nasimba.crt\n, respectively.\n\n\nAcquire Shibboleth keystore's password this instance uses. One option is to get it from the \nsetup.properties.last\n file: \n# cat /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last | grep -i 'asimbaJksPass'\n\n\nMerge together certificate and key files into PKCS12 archive: \n# openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey /etc/certs/asimba.key -in /etc/certs/asimba.crt -out /etc/certs/asimba.pkcs12 \\\n-passout pass:YOUR_ASIMBA_KEYSTORE_PASS -name your-instance-hostname\n\n\nTransform your PKCS12 archive into new instance's Asimba's java keystore file: \n# keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore /etc/certs/asimba.pkcs12 -srcstorepass YOUR_ASIMBA_KEYSTORE_PASS \\\n-srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore /etc/certs/asimbaIDP.jks -deststoretype JKS -deststorepass YOUR_ASIMBA_KEYSTORE_PASS \\\n-keyalg RSA -noprompt\n\n\nVerify that user \u201ctomcat\u201d has read access to all 4 files mentioned (asimba.key, asimba.crt, asimba.pkcs12 and asimbaIDP.jks)\n\n\nCreate a copy of your Shibboleth certificate encoded in DER format: \n# openssl x509 -in /etc/certs/asimba.crt -outform der -out /etc/certs/asimba.der\n\n\nFind out the exact alias name of your current Shibboleth's certificate in the cacerts file: \n# keytool -list -v -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | grep -i '_asimba'\n\nIt should have an alias of sort \u201cyour-instance-hostname_asimba\u201d\n\n\nRemove your old certificate from the store: \n# keytool -delete -alias your-instance-hostname_asimba -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts \\\n-storepass changeit\n\n\nImport the new one with the same alias: \n# keytool -import -alias your-instance-hostname_asimba --trustcacerts -file /etc/certs/asimba.der \\\n-keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit\n\n\nRestart Tomcat service: \n# /etc/init.d/tomcat restart\n\n\nRestart Apache service: \n# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\nUpdating OpenDJ's certificate in the default java keystore\n#\n\n\nAs was mentioned before, if some component of Gluu CE package needs to connect to OpenDJ via LDAPS, it must be able to verify the authenticity and credibility of certificate presented by it by referencing java default keystore. Sometimes you may need to import cacerts file from your previous instance, overwriting corresponding file of the new container. After that it will contain your OpenDJ's certificate from the previous instance which won't match the certificate used by OpenDJ in this one.\n\n\nOpenDJ has its own password-protected java keystore where it stores his key pair together with certificate. It can be found at this path: \n/opt/opendj/config/keystore\n. Your options are either to recreate this keystore using the key pair and certificate from your previous instance (not recommended; you should refer to OpenDJ's documentation for requirements to this keystore's composition if you choose to do so), or remove the certificate of previous OpenDJ's instance from default keystore, and add the current certificate to it. To achieve the later: \n\n\n\n\nLog into your instance: \n# service gluu-server-2.4.3 login\n (if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4 you should update to current version)\n\n\n\n\nIf you didn't preserve original certificates from the \n/etc/certs\n directory of the new container (you should do that) and OpenDJ certificate which is also placed there by setup scripts (it should be named \u201copendj.crt\u201d) got overwritten by the certificate transferred from the previous one, you still can export it from the OpenDJ's own keystore with command like that:\n\n\n\n\nAcquire password for your keystore: \n# cat /opt/opendj/config/keystore.pin\n\n\nFind out the exact alias name of your current OpenDJ certificate: \n# keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/opendj/config/keystore -storepass YOUR_OPENDJ_JKS_PIN\n It should have alias \u201cserver-cert\u201d and there should be no other entries in the keystore, but it may change in the future.\n\n\nFetch the certificate from the store: \n# keytool -export -alias alias_you_discovered -file /etc/certs/opendj-exported-cert.der \\\n-keystore /opt/opendj/config/keystore -storepass opendj_jks_pin\n Now you are ready to import it into default java keystore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out the exact alias name of your current OpenDJ's certificate in the cacerts file: \n# keytool -list -v -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | \\\ngrep -i '_opendj'\n It should have an alias of sort \u201cyour-instance-hostname_opendj\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRemove your old certificate from the store: \n# keytool -delete -alias your-instance-hostname_opendj -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts \\\n-storepass changeit\n\n\nImport the new one with the same alias: \n# keytool -import -alias your-instance-hostname_opendj --trustcacerts -file /etc/certs/opendj-exported-cert.der \\\n-keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit\n\n\nRestart Tomcat service: \n# /etc/init.d/tomcat restart\n\n\nRestart Apache service: \n# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\nHow to test\n#\n\n\nYou can verify that the certificate in cacerts file is the same as in the OpenDJ's keystore using the same \u201ckeytool -list\u201d commands as before. Failure when establishing SSL/TLS connection with OpenDJ will result in errors appearing in \n/opt/idp/logs/idp-process.log\n and \n/opt/tomcat/logs/wrapper.log\n during Tomcat's startup.",

To achieve the later:    Log into your instance:  # service gluu-server-2.4.3 login  (if you use Gluu CE older than 2.4 you should update to current version)   If you didn't preserve original certificates from the  /etc/certs  directory of the new container (you should do that) and OpenDJ certificate which is also placed there by setup scripts (it should be named \u201copendj.crt\u201d) got overwritten by the certificate transferred from the previous one, you still can export it from the OpenDJ's own keystore with command like that:   Acquire password for your keystore:  # cat /opt/opendj/config/keystore.pin  Find out the exact alias name of your current OpenDJ certificate:  # keytool -list -v -keystore /opt/opendj/config/keystore -storepass YOUR_OPENDJ_JKS_PIN  It should have alias \u201cserver-cert\u201d and there should be no other entries in the keystore, but it may change in the future.  Fetch the certificate from the store:  # keytool -export -alias alias_you_discovered -file /etc/certs/opendj-exported-cert.der \\\n-keystore /opt/opendj/config/keystore -storepass opendj_jks_pin  Now you are ready to import it into default java keystore     Find out the exact alias name of your current OpenDJ's certificate in the cacerts file:  # keytool -list -v -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit | \\\ngrep -i '_opendj'  It should have an alias of sort \u201cyour-instance-hostname_opendj\u201d   Remove your old certificate from the store:  # keytool -delete -alias your-instance-hostname_opendj -keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts \\\n-storepass changeit  Import the new one with the same alias:  # keytool -import -alias your-instance-hostname_opendj --trustcacerts -file /etc/certs/opendj-exported-cert.der \\\n-keystore /usr/java/latest/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit  Restart Tomcat service:  # /etc/init.d/tomcat restart  Restart Apache service:  # /etc/init.d/apache2 restart",
