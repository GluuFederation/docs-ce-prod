# Local User Management
In this document we cover managing people in the Gluu Server's OpenLDAP Directory and graphical user interface "oxTrust".

We also briefly cover the Gluu Server's **very basic** out-of-the-box user registration feature. However, when it comes to user registration, we almost always recommend writing your own registration process, then using the [SCIM 2.0 APIs](./scim2.md) to register the users in your Gluu service. 

## Manage users in Gluu LDAP
All the data generated by the Gluu Server is stored in its local LDAP server (included in every deployment). In the LDAP you can see full details like how OpenID Connect clients are stored and how user objects are mapped in the LDAP tree.

You will need an LDAP browser like [JXplorer](http://jxplorer.org/) and can find configuration in `/opt/gluu-server-3.1.5/etc/gluu/conf/ox-ldap.properties`, e.g.:

For OpenDJ: 

```
bindDN: cn=directory manager
bindPassword: foobar
servers: localhost:1636
```


For OpenLDAP: 

```
bindDN: cn=directory manager,o=gluu
bindPassword: foobar
servers: localhost:1636
```

You will need to establish a tunnel from your computer to the target Gluu Server's LDAP. Tunneling is required because Gluu Server's LDAP port, 1636, is not exposed to the Internet.

In the below example we are showing how to connect and use Gluu Server's internal LDAP server with any LDAP browser. 

 - Create tunnel:   
   - `ssh -L 5901:localhost:1636 root@[ip_of_Gluu_server]`
 - Open LDAP browser        
   - Create new connection

   - Perform authentication. 'Password' is the the password of 'admin' user.

   - Browse ldap and go to 'ou=people'.

## Manage People in oxTrust
To manage people in oxTrust, navigate to `User` > `Manage People`.

From this interface you can add and search users. Because the user database can potentially be very large, a value with at least two characters is required in the search field. In other words, you can not click search with a blank entry to populate all users. If you need to see all users, this would be best performed manually within the [Gluu LDAP server](#manage-users-in-gluu-ldap). Upon performing a user search in oxTrust a list will be populated with all users that match the search.

![Search Users](../img/admin-guide/user/admin_users_searchadmin.png)

To edit a user, simply click on any of the hyperlinks associated with
that user and you will be taken to a user management interface where you
can modify specific attributes relating to that user.

![Manage Users](../img/admin-guide/user/admin_users_edituser.png)

### Managing associated Pairwise IDs
If the user has any associated [Pairwise IDs](../admin-guide/openid-connect.md#subject-identifier-types), they will be displayed in a table on the bottom of the page. If an associated Pairwise ID needs to be removed, just click the `Remove` button.

![Pairwise IDs](../img/admin-guide/user/admin_users_pairwise.png)

### Managing associated 2FA devices

Likewise, if the user has any associated 2FA devices, they will be displayed in their own table at the bottom of the page. If an associated 2FA device needs to be removed, just click the `Remove` button.

## Manage Groups in oxTrust
Out of the box, the Gluu Server includes one group: the Gluu Manager
Group (`gluuManager`). Groups can be added and populated as
needed. By using the `Manage Groups` feature, the Gluu Server
Administrator can add, delete or modify any group or user within a
group. The list of available groups can be viewed by hitting the
`Search` button with a blank search box.
![Manage User Groups](../img/admin-guide/user/admin_users_managegroups.png)

The Gluu Server Administrator can modify information such as Display
Name, Group Owner, Visibility type etc. The Server Administrator can
also add or delete users within existing groups. The group information
is represented as shown below.
![View group information](../img/admin-guide/user/admin_users_groupinfo.png)

If any member of the Organization is required to be added in any
specific group, this can be achieved be clicking on the Add Member
button. The flow is _Add Member --> Search the name/email of the user
--> Select the user --> Click OK --> Update._

## Import People in oxTrust

Gluu administrators can import users from an excel file by navigating to `Users` > `Import People`.

![image](../img/admin-guide/user/import-people_add.png)

* Click the `Add` button to select the file from which the users will be imported. 

The supported excel formats are `xls` and `xlsx`.

![image](../img/admin-guide/user/import-people_validate.png)

* The file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the `Validate` button.   

* Click on the `Import` button to complete the import of users.   

### File structure

The excel file needs to contain the following default fields from which user data will be pulled. 

* Username

* First Name

* Last Name

* Email

!!! Note
    Make sure to use the *exact* spelling as shown above. 

Gluu administrators can define additionals supported fields for import by navigating to:  

   * Log into Gluu Admin UI   
   * Navigate to `Organization Configuration` > `JSON Configuration`   
   * Select `oxTrust Import Configuration` tab    
 
   
## User Registration 
The Gluu Server is shipped with a user registration script that implements a very basic user registration process. 

In most situations, we recommend writing a custom registraton app and then using Gluu's [SCIM 2.0 endpoints](./scim2.md#supporting-a-user-registration-process-with-scim) to send the identity data to Gluu. Using SCIM will give you more control and flexibility over the registration process. Also, since oxTrust is frequently not Internet facing, the registration page (`https://<hostname>/identity/register`) may not be available to a user on the web.        

Instructions for using Gluu's user registration functionality follows: 

### Enable User Registration
To enable user registration via the Gluu Server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `Custom Scripts` and select the `User Registration` tab;   
2. Find the `Enabled` field and check the box;     
3. Click the `Update` button at the bottom of the page;      
4. New users will now be able to register for accounts at: `https://<hostname>/identity/register`.  

!!! Note 
    When user registration is handled via oxTrust, users can **not** be added to a backend LDAP or Active Directory server. This means that self-registration via oxTrust is only effective if users are authenticated by GluuLDAP (and not a backend LDAP or AD server).

### Adding attributes to registration
A limited number of attributes are present in the default registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added via the GUI by navigating to `Organization Configuration` > `Manage Registration`. Learn how to [add attributes](../admin-guide/oxtrust-ui.md#manage-registration) to the default registration form. 

### Manual approval of new users
By default the `Custom property (key/value)` field will include the value: `enable_user` and `true`. This enables new users to login as soon as registration is complete. If you want to manually review and approve new user registrations, you can set this value to `false` as shown in the screenshot below.
