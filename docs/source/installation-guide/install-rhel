# Installation 
## Overview
There are Gluu Server Linux packages for Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and Debian operating systems. The installation procedure is similar across all distributions: 

1. [Install the Linux package](#install-the-package)
2. [Start the Server and log in to the container](#start-the-server-and-log-in)
3. [Run `setup.py`](#run-setuppy)
4. [Sign in via browser](#sign-in-via-browser)
5. [Disable Gluu repositories](#disable-gluu-repositories)

!!! Note
    The below instructions are intended for single server Gluu deployments. If you intend to cluster your Gluu Server to achieve fail-over and high availability, please refer to the [cluster documentation](./cluster.md)

## Prerequisites
Make sure the target server or VM meets **all minimum requirements** as specified in the [VM Preparation Guide](../installation-guide/index.md).   

There are a few system specific notes to follow:  

- **Linux containers (e.g. Docker)**: This guide does not support installation via Linux containers. See [Gluu Server Docker Edition (DE)](https://gluu.org/docs/de) documentation for detailed instructions.
  

## Instructions

### Install the package

Installation of the Gluu server will be done under `/root`. 
The Gluu Server will create its file system under `/root/` and will be installed under `/opt`. File size and [minimum requirements](../installation-guide/index.md) remain the same as the host.

#### RHEL 7.x

```
wget https://repo.gluu.org/rhel/Gluu-rhel-7-testing.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/Gluu.repo
```

```
wget https://repo.gluu.org/rhel/RPM-GPG-KEY-GLUU -O /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-GLUU
```

```
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-GLUU
```

```
yum clean all
```

```
yum install gluu-server-4.0
```

### Start the server and log in

The Gluu Server is a chroot container, which must be started to proceed. 

Run the following commands: 

```
/sbin/gluu-serverd-4.0 enable
```

```
/sbin/gluu-serverd-4.0 start
```

```
/sbin/gluu-serverd-4.0 login
```

!!! Note
    Only use `enable` the first time you start the Gluu Server.

### Run `setup.py`

Configuration is completed by running `setup.py` from inside the chroot container. This generates certificates, salt values, and renders configuration files.

```
cd /install/community-edition-setup
```

```
./setup.py
```   

See the [Setup Script Documentation](./setup_py.md#setup-prompt) for more detail on setup script options.

### Sign in via browser

Wait about 10 minutes in total for the server to restart and finalize its configuration. After that period, sign in via a web browser. The username will be `admin` and your password will be the `ldap_password` you provided during installation. 

!!! Note   
    If the Gluu Server login page does not appear, confirm that port 443 is open in the VM. If it is not open, open port 443 and try to reach the host in the browser again.   

### Disable Gluu Repositories

To prevent involuntary overwrites of the currently deployed instance (in case a newer version of the same package is found during regular OS updates), disable the previously added Gluu repositories after initial installation.

Edit `/etc/yum.repos.d/Gluu.repo` so that the `enabled=1` clause is changed to `enabled=0`        

!!! Note
    The Gluu Server does **not** support package updates/upgrades via Linux package management (i.e. using commands like `# yum update` or `# apt-get update`). For upgrade instructions, see the [upgrade docs](../upgrade/index.md).

## Backups
Sometimes things go wrong! It can be difficult to troubleshoot issues if the steps to reproduce the issue are not clearly documented. This is why we **always** recommend creating [backups of your Gluu Server](../operation/backup.md). 

## Uninstallation

Run the following commands:

```
/sbin/gluu-serverd-4.0 disable
```

```
/sbin/gluu-serverd-4.0 stop
```

```
yum remove gluu-server-4.0 
```

```
rm -rf /opt/gluu-server-4.0.save
```

!!! Note
    `apt-get purge gluu-server-4.0` or `apt-get remove --purge gluu-server-4.0` can also be used to uninstall and remove all the folders and services of the Gluu Server. Make sure to back up ALL directories of `/opt` into other direction (tmp or root directory itself) before running the purge command.

## Support
