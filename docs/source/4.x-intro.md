# What's new in Gluu Server v4

## Version 4.0

### Persistence redesign
In 4.0, we redesigned the Gluu Server persistence layer to be more modular. Previously the Gluu Server was tightly bundled with LDAP. Now, any persistence mechanism can be supported with a jar file that implements the base Persistence API. The desired mechanism can then be specifed in `gluu.properties`.  

### Extensive Passport redesign
4.0 features better support for attribute mapping and transformations during "inbound identity" workflows, and improved support for external OpenID Connect providers ("inbound OpenID"). In addition, all Passport configuration changes can now be performed in the oxTrust admin UI. [Read the docs](./authn-guide/passport.md).

### More SAML IDP features
NameIDs can now be [configured inside oxTrust](./admin-guide/saml.md#configure-nameid-in-oxtrust), and [SAML ACRS parameters](./admin-guide/saml.md#authncontextclassref-support) are now supported, which, when used in conjunction with [force authentication](./admin-guide/saml.md#force-authentication), enables stepped-up authentication for SAML SPs. 

### Support for Radius authentication
The Gluu Server now includes a new optional component, a RADIUS server, to enable SSO and 2FA via Super Gluu to non-web applications like SSH, VPN, and wi-fi. [Read the docs](./admin-guide/radius-server/gluu-radius.md).

### Improved clean up service
Introduced in CE 3.1.6, `cleanService` is now more configurable. This service periodically removes unused and expired cache and session-related database entries to improve server performance. [Read the docs](./operation/cleanup.md).

### Updated libraries and components 
4.0 includes the latest version of Shibboleth, updated java libraries and Jetty, and Oracle JDK has been replaced with Amazon Corretto.

### Minor bug fixes and feature improvements
A variety of bug fixes and UX improvements are included with the latest release. See our [complete release notes](https://gluu.org/docs/ce/4.0/release-notes/#changes).
