## Overview 
Gluu offers OAuth 2.0 client software called [oxd](https://oxd.gluu.org) to simplify the process of securing and integrating **server-side web applications** with the Gluu Server.  

## oxd API 
The oxd server supports the OpenID Connect and UMA profiles of OAuth 2.0. OpenID Connect can be used to send a user for authentication and gather identity information about the user. UMA can be used to manage what digital resources the user should have access to.

## Libraries
There are native libraries that wrap the oxd APIs for Php, Java, Python, Node, Ruby, C#, .Net and more. 

[Read the oxd libraries docs](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/libraries/api-client-libraries/).

## License
oxd is commercially licensed software. You can obtain your license and a $50 credit to get started by signing up on the [oxd website](http://oxd.gluu.org).
