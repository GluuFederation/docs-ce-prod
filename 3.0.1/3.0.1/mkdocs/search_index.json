The most common use case for the Gluu Server is Single \nSign-On (SSO). Other common use cases include mobile authentication, \nAPI access management, two-factor authentication, customer identity\nand access management (CIAM), and identity federation. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is a container distribution composed of software written by Gluu and incorporated from other open source projects. Gluu\nprojects are frequently prefixed with our open source handle: \nox\n (e.g. oxAuth, oxTrust). Any code in the Gluu Server that we wrote is MIT license, and is available on \nGithub\n. \n\n\nSaaS, custom, open source and commercial software can be made more \nsecure by leveraging a central authentication and authorization service. \nBecause there are so many different kinds of apps, there is no way to \n\"top down\" implement proprietary security mechanisms. This is why\nopen standards are so important for IAM. \n\n\nWhile there are many open protocols for IAM, Gluu focuses on just a few. \nConsolidation saves money, and one-off integrations should be avoided. \nOur goal was to support the most widely adopted older protocols, and the \nmost promising new protocols. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports the following open web standards for \nauthentication, authorization, federated identity, and identity management:\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0    \n\n\nSAML 2.0   \n\n\nOpenID Connect    \n\n\nUser Managed Access (UMA)    \n\n\nSimple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM)    \n\n\nFIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F)    \n\n\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)   \n\n\n\n\nIf this is your first exposure to the Gluu Server, welcome to the \ncommunity! We want to see the ecosystem flourish, and ultimately make \nthe Internet a safer, more privacy protected place. In order to do that, \nwe believe we need to keep the Gluu Server free so all kinds of \norganizations can use, contribute and benefit from the software.\n\n\nThese docs are not perfect!

Your application can use any client software that implements the open standards the Gluu Server supports, but you may want to consider using oxd for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\noxd is super-easy to use; \n\n\nWe keep updating oxd to address the latest OAuth 2.0 security knowledge; \n\n\nWe can provide more complete end-to-end support if we know both the client and server software;\n\n\noxd subscriptions help support this project so you can see more enhancements faster; \n\n\nThere are oxd libraries for Php, Python, Java, Node, Ruby, C#, Perl and Go.

This document will provide instructions for preparing your VM for a standard Gluu Server deployment. Once your servers are ready you can move on to the \ninstallation instructions\n. Good luck with your deployment, and welcome to the community!\n\n\nMinimum Requirements\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server Community Edition (CE) needs to be deployed on a \nserver or VM with the following \nminimum\n requirements. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU Unit\n\n\nRAM\n\n\nDisk Space\n\n\nProcessor Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n4GB\n\n\n40GB\n\n\n64 Bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you plan on installing more than the default components (i.e. oxAuth, oxTrust, and LDAP), we recommend that your server or VM have at least 8GB of RAM. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nPlease only post installation issues to \nGluu Support\n if all the above requirements are met!\n\n\n\n\nPorts\n#\n\n\nThe following ports are open to the Internet by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort Number\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nForwards to 443\n\n\n\n\n\n\n443\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nApache HTTPD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\ntcp\n\n\nssh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Descriptors\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server \nrequires\n setting the \nfile descriptors\n to 65k. \nFollow these steps or research how to do this on your Linux platform.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following lines in the \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n file.\n\n\n\n\n* soft nofile 65536\n* hard nofile 262144\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following lines to \n/etc/pam.d/login\n\n\n\n\nsession required pam_limits.so\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease the file descriptor limit to 65535. The system file limit \nis set in \n/proc/sys/fs/file-max\n.\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to check the file descriptor size before increasing, \nand if the file descriptor size more than the default and customized, \nit is the recommended to the use the higher file size.\nFile descriptor size can be found using the below command. \n\n\n# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note command may vary depending on the OS flavor used.\n\n\n\n\necho 65535 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nulimit\n command to set the file descriptor limit to the hard limit specified in \n/etc/security/limits.conf\n.\n\n\n\n\n** ulimit -n unlimited**\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCentos by default will not accept more than the default maximum of 65535. You may get an error while performing the above command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart your system.     \n\n\n\n\nAmazon AWS\n#\n\n\nAmazon AWS instances provide a public and private IP address. While\nrunning the \n/install/community-edition-setup/setup.py\n script, use the\nPrivate IP address. Also, use a hostname other then the long default\nhostname that Amazon provides. Update your DNS or hosts files accordingly.\n\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n#\n\n\nAccessing the Gluu Server on Azure can be a little bit tricky because of\nthe Public/Private IP. Azure assigns a new Public/Private IP\naddresses each time the server is started. \n\n\nSetting up VM\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog into Windows Azure Administrative Panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nVirtual Machines\n tab, and click \nCreate a Virtual Machine\n link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the menu, choose \nCompute\n > \nVirtual Machine\n > \nFrom Gallery\n branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS or CentOS 6.7. Remember to set selinux\n   to permissive if you choose CentOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a name for the VM in the \nVirtual Machine Name\n field and use \nStandard\n for \nTier\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect a server with at least 4GB RAM in the \nSize\n dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a username/password to connect via ssh and upload ssh certificate. Click \nNext\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new cloud service and select \nNone\n for the \nAvailability Set\n option.\n        * Endpoints Section: This is where port forwarding is set so\n      that the internal IP address can be selectively reachable from\n      the outside world. By default, only tcp /22 is there for ssh. The\n      public ports for \nhttp\n and \nhttps\n (tcp ports 80 and 443) have to be\n      added and mapped to the same private ports. If the cloud mappings\n      are flagged conflicting, proceed without setting them. Remember to\n      set them after the creation of the VM. Then, click \nNext\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose not to install \nVM Agent\n and click the \ntick\n button to\n   finalize the VM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the \nDashboard\n tab of VM Management Panel and copy the \nDNS\n    Name\n. This is the name that is used to access the Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to ssh to the server and proceed with the \n    installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinode VM\n#\n\n\nLinode Virtual Machines (VM) use a custom kernel which is not \nsupported by the Gluu Server, therefore the kernel must be updated before \nthe Gluu Server can be installed in a Linode VM. The following steps will \nguide you through kernel update in the Linode VM.\n\n\n\n\nCheck for the current version of the kernel. If the output contains \n-Linode\n, then proceed\n\n\n\n\n# uname -a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to update the kernel:\n\n\n\n\n# apt-get install linux-image-virtual grub2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify \ngrub\n file in the \n/etc/default/\n folder:\n\n\n\n\n# vim /etc/default/grub\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the following lines are present in the grub file\n\n\n\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"console=ttyS0,19200n8\"\nGRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true\nGRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND=\"serial --speed=19200 --unit=0 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally run the following commands to update \ngrub\n and reboot:\n\n\n\n\n# update-grub\n# reboot",

There is a corresponding page in the Gluu Server user interface for each of the sections below. When necessary, this document will link to dedicated sections within the docs where additional operational details are provided.\n\n\nAccessing the UI\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server administration interface is accessible by navigating to \n\nhttps://hostname\n (the one you provided during setup). When you \nfirst complete an installation, the default username is \nadmin\n and \nthe password is the same as the \nLDAP superuser\n password. \n\n\nWelcome Page\n#\n\n\nAfter successful authentication the administrator is taken to the \nDashboard. Some basic information about the VM/server is displayed as \nwell as the server version, free memory, and disk space. In the top \nright there is a user icon which can be used to log out of oxTrust. \nThe left hand menu is used to navigate the admin interface.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\nFrom the configuration tab, the Gluu Server administrator can manage \ncertain non-protocol related tasks.\n\n\nOrganization Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three tabs in the organization configuration page:       \n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n         \n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n         \n\n\noxTrust Settings\n             \n\n\n\n\nSystem Configuration\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-service password reset: Allow users to reset their password via email. In order for this feature to work, the admin will also need to perform \nSMTP Server Configuration\n.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Support: Enable SCIM Support if you plan on using the SCIM protocol to move identity data from applications to Gluu and vice versa.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNS Server(s): If the organization uses any custom \nDNS Server(s)\n, the address should be added here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Log Size (MB): By default the maximum size of the log file is 200 mb. This value can be increased or decreased depending on the organizations requirements.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser can edit their own profile: oxTrust has a profile section for each user. If this option is enabled, users will be able to log into oxTrust and edit the values associated with their user.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Email: This email will be displayed on all error pages with a note instructing users to contact for troubleshooting and  assistance.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Server Configuration\n#\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server needs a mail server in order to send notifications. All fields in this form are manadory and the configuration can be tested before confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFields\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Host\n\n\nHostName of the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Name\n\n\nName of the sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Email Address\n\n\nEmail Address of the Sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires Authentication\n\n\nThis Checkbox is enables authentication of the sender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP User Name\n\n\nUser Name of the SMTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Password\n\n\nPassword for the SMTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequires SSL\n\n\nThis checkbox is to enable the SSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMTP Port\n\n\nPort number of the SMTP server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust Settings\n#\n\n\n\n\nFrom the oxTrust Settings page the administrator can find the oxTrust build date and number, and manage the organization name, logo, and favicon. This page also contains the name of the Gluu Server administrator group. Users added to this group will have administrator access to the Gluu Server.\n\n\nJSON Configuration\n#\n\n\nThere are three tabs included in the \nJSON Configuration\n menu:\n\n\n\n\noxTrust Configuration\n#\n\n\nFrom this tab you can access and edit the oxTrust JSON configuration file. \nClick the update button at the bottom of the page to save any changes. \n\n\nWhiteList/BlackList URIs\n#\n\n\nAn administrator can allow or deny access to URI's by updating JSON properties in the oxTrust UI\n\n\nConfigure WhiteList/BlackList of URIs\n#\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nConfiguration\n > \nJSON Properties\n\n\nClick \noxTrust properties\n tab and search for whitelist and blacklist label.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxAuth Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe oxAuth JSON configuration page gives easy access to the different endpoints used by Gluu Server CE. \nThis page also contains the supported response, grants, and algorithms. \n\n\nSession Management\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server administrator can manage oxAuth sessions by adding the desired session time in seconds as the value for the \nsessionIdUnusedLifetime\n field. Check the \nsession management\n section of the documentation to learn more.\n\n\noxTrust Import Person Configuration\n#\n\n\nThe oxTrust Import Person Configuration page contains the configuration for \nthe file method of importing users into the Gluu Server. The administrator \ncan import users from an \nxls\n file which must be defined in this tab to import \ndata in the LDAP attributes. The default format should contain the following fields: \n\n\n\n\ngivenname\n\n\nsn\n\n\nuid\n\n\nfirstname, \netc..\n\n\n\n\nManage Authentication\n#\n\n\nManage LDAP Authentication\n#\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server administrator to define how and\nwhere the server should connect to authenticate users. If it is a remote\nLDAP/Active Directory server, the values are required. Put the details\nof the data source that you are trying to connect with Gluu Server. For\nexample, the data source can be your back-end Active Directory, or your\nlocal LDAP server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n This field contains the name of the authentication server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n The \nUsername\n for the authentication server (local\n  LDAP/remote LDAP/remote Active Directory) goes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This option can be used to define the total number\n  of simultaneous connections allowed for reading local LDAP/remote Active\n  Directory/remote LDAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Key:\n This field contains the primary key to connect to the\n  authentication server (i.e. SAMAccountName/uid/mail etc.). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Primary Key:\n This field contains the Gluu Server's internal LDAP primary key. Generally the key is either \nuid\n or \nmail\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n The unique name of the authentication server and port number\n  (e.g. auth.company.org:636) goes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n Add base DNs in this field to allow the Gluu Server to\n  connect and search the LDAP server. Every directory tree should be added\n  separately using the \nAdd Base DN\n option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This button assignes a password to\n  authenticate the \nAuthentication Server\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Enable SSL if the authentication server requires a secured port (e.g. 636).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to enable the keys that are inserted\n  in their respective fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeactivate:\n This button \nDeactivates/Activates\n the Gluu Server\n  accessibility for authentication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest LDAP Connection:\n Use this button to check whether the provided\n  information is sufficient to connect to the authentication server. The\n  scan is done in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nThis allows the Gluu Server administrator to select the default\nauthentication method and level for person authentication. Both methods are\nset to \"Default\" until additional authentication mechanisms are enabled\nvia \ncustom scripts\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Method\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication mode\n\n\nThis mode is used when users login to applications via Gluu\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust authentication mode\n\n\nThis mode is used for authentication to the Gluu Server GUI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu Server uses oxAuth as the first step of authentication in all kind \nof SSO protocols ( OpenID Connect, SAML, CAS )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication mode: This mode defines the mode used for general authentication with Service Providers. The mode defined under this tab will not affect the users accessing the oxTrust administrator interface.\n\n\noxTrust authentication mode: This mode is used when the user is accessing the oxTrust administrator interface using the gluu server hostname.\n\n\nPassport Support: This mode uses third-party authentication e.g. Google+, Twitter, Facebook to authenticate users in Gluu Server.\n\n\nCustom Script Authenticaiton: This mode uses custom script and enabled in the oxTrust Admin UI.\n\n\n\n\nManage Custom Scripts\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server exposes interception scripts in places where it is common \nfor organizations to implement custom workflows, or changes to the \nlook and feel of the Gluu Server. The most commonly used scripts are \nfor authentication, authorization, and identity synchronization. Each\ntype of script has its own interface--in other words, what methods are\navailable. For more information, see the reference page detailing each type of \ninterception script\n.\n\n\nManage Registration\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is shipped with a very basic user registration feature. The registration page can be found at \nhttps://<hostname>/identity/register\n. For custom enrollment requirements we recommend that you write a registration page and use SCIM to add the user record to the Gluu Server. Also, in some cases oxTrust is not Internet facing, which makes it a bad option for user registration. Net-net, Use this feature only if you have very basic requirements! See \nuser registration\n for more. \n\n\nThe tab has two options:\n\n\n\n\nDisable Captcha for registration form\n     \n\n\nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n      \n\n\n\n\nDisable Captcha for registration form\n   \n\n\n\n\nThis option adds a required CAPTCHA to the registration form.     \n\n\nConfigure Registration Form Attributes\n    \n\n\n\n\nThis section allows you to manage the list of attributes displayed in the registration form. Search, select, add, and order desired attributes here.\n\n\nAttributes\n#\n\n\nAttributes are individual pieces of user data, like \nuid\n or \nemail\n, that are required by applications in order to identify a user and grant access to protected resources. A list of user attributes that are available in your federation service can be found by navigating to \nConfiguration\n > \nAttributes\n. For a detailed discussion of attributes, visit our \nattributes documentation\n page.\n\n\nCache Refresh\n#\n\n\nCache Refresh, a.k.a. LDAP Synchronization, is the process of connecting one or more existing backend LDAP servers, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the Gluu Server's local LDAP server. \nCache Refresh\n periodically searches these data sources, compares the results to previous searches, and if a changed user account is found, it is updated.The frequency of cache refresh is also set from this page via the \nPolling interval (minutes)\n. The \nkey attribute(s)\n is used to correlate a user if the user is found in more then one LDAP server. In this case, the two entries are joined. The source attributes specify which attributes will be pulled from the backend LDAP server. The backend server address, bind DN and other connection information is speciifed in the \nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n tab. More information on \nLDAP Syncronization\n can be found in the user management section of the docs. \n\n\nConfigure Log Viewer / View Log File\n#\n\n\nThis tool can be used to view file system logs. If you don't like to ssh, \nLog Viewer is your friend! Several common logs are preconfigured, or you can define \nnew logs by specifying the path.\n\n\nServer Status\n#\n\n\nThis page provides basic information about the Gluu Server such as the hostname, IP address, free memory & disk space. The number of users in the backend is also available in this page.\n\n\nCertificates\n#\n\n\nThe certificate page provides summary information about your SSL and SAML certificates. Learn more about \ncertificate management\n in the Gluu Server.\n\n\nSAML\n#\n\n\nIf you deployed the Shibboleth SAML IDP or the Asimba SAML proxy during Gluu Server installation, you will see a link to manage inbound and outbound SAML requirements in the left hand navigation. Learn more about configuring and managing SAML in the \nSAML\n portion of the docs. \n\n\nOpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect protocol is supported by default in all Gluu Server deployments. Learn more about configuring and managing OpenID Connect in the \nOpenID Connect\n portion of the docs. \n\n\nUMA\n#\n\n\nUMA (User-Managed Access) is an access management protocol that is also supported by default in all Gluu Server deployments. Learn more about configuring and managing UMA in the \nUMA\n portion of the docs.\n\n\nUsers\n#\n\n\nThe users tab allows the Gluu admin to perform various user management tasks like adding users, searching users, and importing users from a file. Learn more about managing users in the \nuser management\n portion of the docs. \n\n\nPersonal\n#\n\n\nThe personal tab allows an individual to view and manage (if enabled) their basic profile information. However, since oxTrust is designed to be an administrative tool it is often not Internet facing, making it a bad choice for user self-service profile management. In general, if user profile management is an important requirement for your organization, we recommend writing a separate app or forking our open source \ncredential management app\n.",

Interception scripts can be written in \nJython\n. Jython was chosen because an interpreted language facilitates dynamic creation of business logic, and makes it easier to distribute this logic to a cluster of Gluu servers. Jython enables developers to use either Java or Python classes. Combined with the option of calling web services from Python or Java, this enables the Gluu Server to support any business-driven policy requirement.\n\n\nThe web interface for Custom Scripts can be accessed by navigating to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scritps\n.\n\n\nInterception Script Methods\n#\n\n\nThere are three methods that inherit a base interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited Methods\n\n\nMethod description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef init(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is only called once during the script initialization. It can be used for global script initialization, initiate objects etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef destroy(self, configurationAttributes)\n\n\nThis method is called once to destroy events. It can be used to free resource and objects created in the \ninit()\n method\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndef getApiVersion(self)\n\n\nThe \ngetApiVersion\n method allows API changes in order to do transparent migration from an old script to a new API. Currently all scripts should return \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfigurationAttributes\n parameter is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\n with properties specified in \noxConfigurationProperty\n attributes.\n\n\nThe script manager only loads enabled scripts. Hence, after enabling or disabling a\nscript, the script manager should trigger an event to either load or\ndestroy a script, respectively. All scripts are stored in LDAP in the\n\nou=scripts,o=<org_inum>,o=gluu\n branch.\n\n\nHere is a sample entry:\n\n\n    dn: inum=@!1111!031C.4A65,ou=scripts,o=@!1111,o=gluu\n    objectClass: oxCustomScript\n    objectClass: top\n    description: <custom_script_description>\n    displayName: <display_name>\n    gluuStatus: true\n    inum: @!1111!031C.4A65\n    oxLevel: <priority>\n    oxModuleProperty: {\"value1\":\"module_property_name\",\"value2\":\"module_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxConfigurationProperty: {\"value1\":\"configuration_property_name\",\"value2\":\"configuration_property_value\",\"description\":\"\"}\n    oxRevision: <revision>\n    oxScript: <custom_script>\n    oxScriptType: <script_type>\n    programmingLanguage: python\n\n\n\n\nThe script manager reloads scripts automatically without needing to\nrestart the application once \noxRevision\n is increased.\n\n\nInterception Script Logs\n#\n\n\nThe log files regarding interception scripts are stored in the\n\noxauth.log\n file. The logs are separated according to the module they\naffect. The oxAuth custom script logs are stored in \noxauth_script.log\n\nand the oxTrust custom script logs are stored in the\n\noxtrust_script.log\n. Please refer to these log files to troubleshoot errors in\nthe interception scripts or following the workflow of the script.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA \nprint\n statement may not work on some environments if the \nPYTHON_HOME\n environment variable is not set. Make sure it points to a valid python installation.\n\n\n\n\nMore details on Logs can be found in \nLog Management\n\n\nPerson Authentication\n#\n\n\nFor a list of pre-written, open source Gluu authentication scripts, \nview our \nserver integrations\n\n\nAn authentication script enables you to customize the user\nauthentication experience. For example, you can write a script that\nenables a two-factor authentication mechanism like Duo Security. By\ndefault oxAuth offers basic username/password authentication. Authentication \nscripts allow an admin to implement more secure workflows to meet\nan organizations security requirements.

It is needed in a few cases, for example when an authentication script redirects the user to a 3rd party authentication system and expects the workflow to resume after that. As a result it should return a java array of strings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\nstep\n is a java integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef getPageForStep(self, configurationAttributes, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method allows the admin to render a required page for a specified authentication step. It should return a string value with a path to an XHTML page. If the return value is empty or null, the authenticator should render the default log in page \n/login.xhtml\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod Parameter\n\n\nconfigurationAttributes\n is \njava.util.Map<String, SimpleCustomProperty>\nstep\n is a java integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\ndef logout(self, configurationAttributes, requestParameters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis method is not mandatory. It can be used in cases when you need to execute specific logout logic within the authentication script when oxAuth receives an end session request.

However, using the Gluu Server's \ninterception script infrastructure\n, you can define multiple authentication methods and custom business logic for complex multi-step authentication workflows. You can have multiple authentication mechanisms active at the same time--Web or mobile clients can request a certain authentication type by using standard OpenID Connect request parameters. \n\n\nInterception scripts allow you to configure authentication processes and customize how they are applied.

With over 300 existing\n\"strategies\", Passport provides a crowd-sourced approach to offering your users\nsocial login at popular consumer IDPs. Passport not only normalizes authentication, \nit also provides a standard mapping for user claims. \n\n\nPassport is an Express-based web application. We've modified it \nto call oxTrust APIs for its non-static configuration. Because its \nconfiguration is stored centrally in LDAP, you can scale Passport even \nin clustered topologies.\n\n\nThe Gluu Server uses the \nPassport interception script\n to enable social login. This \nscript is included in our default distribution. Post-authentication,\nthis script uses just-in-time provisioning to add users to the Gluu\nLDAP server if a local account does not already exist. In this way, \nthe Gluu SAML and OpenID Connect providers can gather claims and maintain\nSSO as normal.\n\n\nSequence Diagram\n#\n\n\nBelow is a sequence diagram to help clarify the workflow for user\nauthentication and provisioning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGluu server calls Node-Passport server for JWT token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server generates a JWT token and provides it in response to Gluu server.\n\n\nGluu server requests Node-Passport server with JWT token to authenticate user for a social network provider.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user to social media authentication provider.\n\n\nAfter successful authentication of user, social network will callback Node-Passport server along with user details and access token.\n\n\nNode-Passport server will redirect user back to Gluu server with user details and access token.\n\n\nGluu server\u2019s interception script will check if the user exists in LDAP server. If the user exists then the user will be logged into the system. If not, the interception script will create a new user with the required details and log the user into the system.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Passport.js with Gluu\n#\n\n\nDuring installation of the Gluu Server select \nyes\n to install Passport.js when prompted.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n.\n\n\nEnable passport script in \nPerson Authentication\n Tab.\n\n\nClick on \nupdate\n at the end of the page.\n\n\nEnable UMA authorization policy in \nUMA authorization policy\n tab.\n\n\nClick on \nupdate\n.\n\n\nTo set the strategies navigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Authentication\n > \nDefault Authenticaion\n\n\nChange the Default Authentication mode to \npassport\n\n\nClick on \nPassport Authentication Method\n tab and \nPassport Support\n to enabled.\n\n\nAdd your desired strategies. The \nAdd Strategy\n field values for common providers are:\n\n\ngoogle\n for GPlus Authentication\n\n\ntwitter\n for Twitter Authentication\n\n\nlinkedin\n for LinkedIn Authentication\n\n\ngithub\n for Github Authentication\n\n\nfacebook\n for Facebook Authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the strategy details like clientID and clientSecret \n(obtained from the provider, after the app is created in the provider form). \n\n\n\n\nOnce the configuration and settings have been entered, restart the \npassport service or Gluu Server by following the below instructions:\n\n\na. Login to chroot.\n\n\nb. Enter the following command to stop: \nservice passport stop\n\n\nc. Enter the following command to start: \nservice passport start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nStrategies names and field names are case sensitive.\n\n\n\n\nHow to make a new app to use Passport\n#\n\n\nEvery provider has different protocols and ways to create the app. We \nwill look at one of the most common providers \"facebook\" and create a new app.\n\n\n\n\nLogin to https://developers.facebook.com\n\n\nClick on Add a new App from My Apps dropdown\n\n\nFill the required details and click the create Create App ID button to create the app.\n\n\nClick on the dashboard menu and get the clientID and clientSecret which can be used with the passport.\n\n\nClick on settings menu and put the domain of your gluu server in the site url field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If there is a field for Authorized redirect URIs, make sure your apps list of Authorized redirect URIs contains the passport \nstrategy's callback. For example, if your gluu server points to \nhttps://example.gluu.org\n and the strategy is \nfacebook\n, the list of Authorized redirect URIs should contain \nhttps://example.gluu.org/passport/auth/facebook/callback.\n \n\n\nHow Passport is used in Gluu\n#\n\n\nBefore starting the development it is recommended to switch to node user,\n you can switch to node user by following command.\n\n\nsu - node\n\n\n\n\nTo use node js and npm execute following command.\n\n\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/node/bin\n\n\n\n\n All the paths in the following guide is relative to path: \n/opt/gluu/node/passport/\n \n*\n\n\nThe best way to add new strategies to Passport is to find an applicable npm module for your desired strategy. Let's start with an example. In this example we will consider adding facebook strategy.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to add facebook strategy, search for passport-facebook npm module where you can select the npm module and then add the module to passport server.\n\n\nLet's say we found this module \"passport-facebook\" and want to use this module for facebook authentication. Install the module in passport by executing the following command: \nnpm install passport-facebook --save\n.\n\n\nConfigure the strategy.\n\n\nConfigure routes for the strategy.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the strategy using setup script\n#\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAll these configuration are performed during execution of setup script at the time of configuring Gluu. These steps are not required to be followed, these content are for your reference\n\n\n\n\nvar passport = require('passport');\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;\n\nvar setCredentials = function(credentials) {\n    var callbackURL = global.applicationHost.concat(\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\");\n    passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({\n            clientID: credentials.clientID,\n            clientSecret: credentials.clientSecret,\n            callbackURL: callbackURL,\n            enableProof: true,\n            profileFields: ['id', 'name', 'displayName', 'email']\n        },\n        function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {\n            var userProfile = {\n                id: profile._json.id,\n                name: profile.displayName,\n                username: profile.username || profile._json.id,\n                email: profile._json.email,\n                givenName: profile._json.first_name,\n                familyName: profile._json.last_name,\n                provider: profile.provider,\n                accessToken: accessToken\n            };\n            return done(null, userProfile);\n        }\n    ));\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    passport: passport,\n    setCredentials: setCredentials\n};\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the facebook strategy configured. For facebook \nthe required parameters are \nclientID\n, \nclientSecret\n and \ncallbackURL\n. You \ncan search for more configurations depending on the requirements and \nconfigure accordingly.\n\n\nThe function \nsetCredentials\n is used to configure credentials of a strategy. \nEach strategy has a setCredentials method to configure the strategy. \nThe parameter credentials holds the values that are stored in the oxTrust.\n\n\nThe parameter callbackURL should point to the callback route that we \nwill configure in step 4. As we are configuring facebook strategy, the \n\ncallbackURL\n can be set to \n\"/passport/auth/facebook/callback\"\n \naccording the the convention of the app. You can customise the \n\ncallbackURL\n but it is recommended not to change the convention.\n\n\nThe callback function of passport strategy has different number of parameters and the data in \nthose parameters which are required to be mapped to the userProfile \nkeys which are \nid, name, username, email, givenName, familyName, provider, accessToken\n. \nHere id and provider params are must.

First we are going to register the \ncallback route and then the authenticate route.\n\n\nThe authenticate route first validates the jwt token that is been sent by\nGluu Server to passport server. If the JWT is valid then the user is \nredirected to the strategy and user can be authenticated there and the \nresponse of the user authentication is redirected to callback route.\n\n\nIf the callback routes receives the user data then user is been \nredirected to Gluu.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nscope value can be set from the strategy itself if the strategy supports that \nor you can set the scope value here too.\n\n\nThe callbackResponse method return the control to Gluu server and \nuser is been enrolled in the system.\n\n\nCall method to configure the strategy\n#\n\n\nIn this step we are going to call the setCredentials method of the \nstrategy that we have created.\n\n\nGo to the file server/auth/configureStrategies.js and require the strategy that we have created.\n\n\nvar FacebookStrategy = require('./facebook');\n\n\n\n\nAnd then in setConfiguratins function, call the setCredentials \nmethod if the strategy data is received.\n\n\n//FacebookStrategy\nif (data.passportStrategies.facebook) {\n    logger.log('info', 'Facebook Strategy details received');\n    logger.sendMQMessage('info: Facebook Strategy details received');\n    FacebookStrategy.setCredentials(data.passportStrategies.facebook);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will configure the passport strategy if the details of the \nstrategy are received from passport API.\n\n\nAdd button for the configured strategy in passport authentication UI.\n#\n\n\nSo far the passport server is ready with the new strategy that we have \ncreated, but to call the strategy we need to add a button which calls \nthe new strategy.\n\n\n<a data-p=\"facebook\" class=\"provider\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" style=\"height:40px; width:120px\">\n    <img alt=\"facebook\" src=\"img/facebook.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\"></img>\n</a>\n\n\n\n\nHere the data-p and class=\"provider\" are required to call the strategy. \nThe data-p attribute should hold the value of the route that we created \nin routes.\n\n\n//==================== facebook ================\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/callback',\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        failureRedirect: '/passport/login'\n    }),\n    callbackResponse);\n\nrouter.get('/auth/facebook/:token',\n    validateToken,\n    passportFacebook.authenticate('facebook', {\n        scope: ['email']\n    }));\n\n\n\n\nIn order to call the Strategy, the request URL to call the API must \nmatch the route that we configured.",

You can follow these \n\ninstructions\n.\n\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do is Create a Project on Google to obtain\nclient credentials. Click \"Create project\" and enter your desired\nproject name.        \n\n\n              \n\n\nThen click on your newly created project from the listing on the\ndashboard, and under the Credentials section, create a new \"OAuth 2.0\nclient ID\".        \n\n\n       \n\n\nGoogle will ask you to configure your consent screen, to add your logo\nand other information displayed to the user to authorize Google to\nrelease information.       \n\n\n       \n\n\nFill out the form...       \n\n\n       \n\n\nNow you're ready to create the credentials. Enter \"Authorized JavaScript\norigins\". It should be the uri of your Gluu Server--for example \nhttps://idp.example.com\n.       \n\n\n       \n\n\nGoogle will display the client-id and secret. Ignore that for now. Instead, download the JSON file which you are going to upload into\nyour Gluu Server next.       \n\n\n       \n\n\nMove this file to the location \n/etc/gluu/conf/google.json\n. The JSON\nfile will look something like this example:       \n\n\n{\n  \"web\": {\n    \"client_id\": \"7a64e55f-724d4e8c91823d5f1f18a0b2.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n    \"auth_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/auth\",\n    \"token_uri\": \"https:\\/\\/accounts.google.com\\/o\\/oauth2\\/token\",\n    \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https:\\/\\/www.googleapis.com\\/oauth2\\/v1\\/certs\",\n    \"client_secret\": \"bb76a2c99be94e35b874\",\n    \"javascript_origins\": [\n    \"https:\\/\\/brookie.gluu.info\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to enable Google+ API's:       \n\n\n\n\nNavigate back to the Google API \nconsole\n\n\nSelect project and enter project name\n\n\nOpen new project \"API & auth -> API\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n\n\nClick \"Google+ API\"\n\n\nClick \"Enable API\" button\n\n\n\n\nConfigure oxTrust\n#\n\n\nFollow the steps below to configure the certificate authentication in the oxTrust Admin GUI.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n > \nPerson Authentication\n.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Custom Scritp\n button     \n\n\nadd-script-button\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the form and add the \nGoogle External Authenticator\n Script.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to add some custom properties:       \n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n: \n/etc/gluu/conf/google.json\n\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n: enroll\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n: email, given_name, family_name, and locale\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n: uid, mail, givenName, sn, cn, preferredLanguage\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file\n - It is a mandatory property that holds\n   the path to the application configuration file downloaded from Google\n   console for application. An example is \n/etc/certs/gplus_client_secrets.json\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Google App\n#\n\n\nThese are the single steps needed to ClientSecret and ClientID or Google JSON:\n\n\na) Log into: \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/project\n\n\nb) Click \"Create project\" and enter project name\n\n\nc) Open new project \"API & auth -> Credentials\" menu item in configuration navigation tree\n\n\nd) Click \"Add credential\" with type \"OAuth 2.0 client ID\"\n\n\ne) Select \"Web application\" application type\n\n\nf) Enter \"Authorized JavaScript origins\".

It is an\noptional property. If this property isn't specified the script tries to\nfind the user in the local LDAP by 'subject_identifier' claim specified\nin id_token. If this property has a 'map' value the script allows to map\n'subject_identifier' to the local user account. If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the \ngplus_local_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_local_attributes_list\n - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the\n\ngplus_remote_attributes_list\n property. It is mandatory only if\n\ngplus_deployment_type\n is set to 'enroll'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextension_module\n - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus_client_configuration_attribute\n - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override\n\ngplus_client_secrets_file file\n content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate \ngplus_client_secrets.json\n\nconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n#\n\n\nOne simple way to test the configuration is to use oxTrust. In the\n\"Configure Authentication\" dropdown menu, select \"Google\" (or whatever\nyou entered as the \"Name\" of the custom authentication script--as the\ndefault authentication method.       \n\n\n       \n\n\nAfter you login and logout, you should be presented with a new login\nform that has the Google login button:       \n\n\n       \n\n\nAfter clicking the Google login button, you are presented for\nauthorization--Google needs to make sure its ok to release attributes to\nthe Gluu Server:       \n\n\n       \n\n\nIf the script doesn't work, and you locked yourself out of oxTrust,\ndon't worry! You can create an LDIF file, for example \nrevert.ldif\n, to\nset back the default authentication method, like this:       \n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\n\n\noxAuthenticationMode corresponds to the 'Name' of the customer\nauthentication script in oxTrust. Use \ninternal\n to revert to the\ndefault LDAP authentication. You'll have to change the \ninum\n with the\n\ninum\n of your installation. You can find it using ldapsearch like this:\n\n\nroot@gluu3-ubuntu:/opt/symas/bin# ./ldapsearch -h locahost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager,o=gluu\" -w \"{password provided during setup}\" -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" inum\n\n\n\n\n~/.pw\n is a file with your Directory Manager password. If you don't\nremember it, try to find it using \ngrep\n: \n\n\ngrep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/setup.properties.last\n\n\n\n\nOnce your LDIF looks ok, then use \nldapmodify\n to revert back to\npassword authentication:\n\n\nroot@gluu3-ubuntu:/opt/symas/bin# ./ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1389 -D \"cn=directory manager,o=gluu\" -w \"{password provided during setup}\" -f revert.ldif\n\n\n\n\nIf things go wrong, it can leave the sessions in your browser in a bad\nstate. If things get really weird, remove the cookies in your browser\nfor the hostname of your Gluu Server.",

If this property has an\n'enroll' value the script adds a new user to the local LDAP with status\n'active'. In order to map the IDP attributes to the local attributes it\nuses properties from both gplus_remote_attributes_list and\ngplus_local_attributes_list. The allowed values are map and enroll.    gplus_remote_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of attribute\nnames (user claims) that Google+ returns which map to local attributes\nin the  gplus_local_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    gplus_local_attributes_list  - Comma-separated list of Gluu Server\nLDAP attribute names that are mapped to Google user claims from the gplus_remote_attributes_list  property. It is mandatory only if gplus_deployment_type  is set to 'enroll'.    extension_module  - Optional property to specify the full path of\nan external module that implements two methods:        # This is called when the authentication script initializes\n    def init(conf_attr):\n        # Code here\n        return True/False\n\n    # This is called after authentication\n    def postLogin(conf_attr, user):\n        # Code here\n        return True    # or return False   gplus_client_configuration_attribute  - Optional property to\nspecify the client entry attribute name which can override gplus_client_secrets_file file  content. It can be used in cases when\nall clients should use a separate  gplus_client_secrets.json \nconfiguration.",

            "text": "Custom Authentication Script Tutorial\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nInterception scripts\n enable you to customize your Gluu authentication service. In an interception script you can call external APIs, like a commercial authentication service, a DDoS protection service, a fraud detection service, etc., to make your authentication process more secure. In addition, interception scripts give you the ability to implement business driven policies during authentication. \n\n\nFor example, you may want to only prompt users in a certain group for two-factor authentication. Or, you may want to only prompt a user for two-factor authentication if the request is coming from an unknown IP address. These types of policies can be incorporated into your authentication service by writing an interception script that uses the \nmethods\n described below.\n\n\nThis tutorial explains how to write a script to implement a two-step out-of-band authentication using Twilio to send an SMS with a one-time password. At the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of how to write your own custom scripts. For reference, you can review the completed Twilio custom authentication script \nhere\n. \n\n\nSuggested Development Environment\n#\n\n\nGluu Server custom scripts are written in \nJython\n. We recommended using Eclipse for coding purposes.\n\n\nCustom Script Location\n#\n\n\nThe GUI for custom authentication scripts can be found by navigating to \n\n\nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n > \nPerson Authentication\n. \n\n\nCustom scripts can either be inserted directly into the GUI or you can \nspecify a path to the script. We recommend specifying a path in order to \nmake development easier. To specify a path, select \nFile\n from the \nScript Location Type\n field in oxTrust and the \nScript Path\n input box will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nLDAP\n option in the \nScript Location Type\n can be used to store the script in the LDAP tree once development is complete. Remember that selecting the \nLDAP\n method requires the script to be copied in the input box that appears upon LDAP selection:\n\n\n\n\nFields in Custom Script:\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nName of the Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n[optional] Description of the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Language\n\n\nCurrently Python is supported, in the future jscript and Java will be added\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\n\n\nAuthentication Level for the authentication, which determines the security level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Type\n\n\nThe script can be stored in a \"File\" or in \"LDAP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage Type\n\n\nThe script can be written for Web, Native or Both types of applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustome Property\n\n\nDetermines the key and value of the custom property, which can be added to the authentication to pass values between steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript Box\n\n\nScript Box will displayed if Location Type is selected as \"File\", to enter the path of the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\n\nScript Box will be displayed when Location Type is selected as \"LDAP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Initial Files\n#\n\n\nCreate the following files:\n\n\n\n\nA Python file for your script;\n\n\nOne or more XHTML files if you have a custom form for your authentication;\n\n\nOne or more XML files (you'll need one for each XHTML file) that provide information to the Tomcat server about how to display the XHTML file.\n\n\n\n\nSamples and Documentation\n#\n\n\nThere are many good examples of authentication interception scripts in Gluu's \noxAuth integrations folder\n. The respective \nXHTML\n and \nXML\n files are checked into the \nauth folder\n. The interfaces for authentication interception scripts can be found in the \nGluu Documentation\n.\n\n\nWe used the \nBasic Script\n \nas a template. The \nWikid forms\n \nwere also used as a template since it requires that we pass the value of the \ncode\n obtained from Twilio to step 2 of the authentication to validate and authenticate the user.\n\n\nThe \nWikid authentication\n script was also looked upon for examples on how to process the form.\n\n\nImplement methods - Using Twilio SMS\n#\n\n\nSteps to add a custom template and pass values between 2 steps of authentication for our sample \n\nTwilio script\n:\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Gluu UI;\n\n\nNavigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n;\n\n\nScroll to the end of the page and click \nAdd custom script configuration\n;\n\n\nEnter the Name, Description, and Programming Language (Python will be by default);\n\n\nSelect the Level to set a security level;\n\n\nSelect Location Type for the script;\n\n\nSelect the Usage Type for the authentication;\n\n\nDefine Custom property, which in our example is provided by Twilio;\n\n\nClick on Enabled to enable the script;\n\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the form and click \nsubmit\n;\n\n\nAfter the custom script is added, navigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Authenticaion\n > \nDefault Authentication Method\n and change the oxTrust authentication mode to \"Twilio\" (or the custom name of your script). \n\n\n\n\nNote: All three below custom properties are mandatory for the Twilio Two-Factor Authentication script to work\n     \n\n\n\n\nACCOUNT_SID - Numerical sequence of numbers, to identify the token assigned to the user associated with Twilio.      \n\n\nAUTH TOKEN  - Alphanumerical number provided by Twilio for the account holder to identify the user.      \n\n\nFROM_NUMBER - Number which is either assigned by Twilio or can be a number user provides to send the code from.       \n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the below illustration:\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n#\n\n\nauthenticate():\n    \n\nThe most important method to implement is the \nauthenticate\n method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the \nif (step == 1):\n statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value is stored in LDAP using a temporarily created attribute that can be retrieved in step 2. The step is sent to the \nauthenticate\n method, which helps to save and retrieve the values as required.\n\n\nBelow are a few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as required:\n\n\nrandom.randit()\n   \n\n\nrandom.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\")\n Generates the code as required.     \n\n\nExample: \nrandom.randit(10000,99999)\n\n\ncontext.set()\n   \n\nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to LDAP by creating a temporary attribute which has a limited lifetime and can be retrieved within the life span, otherwise it expires and the session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method. \ncontext.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", <key>)\n where \n<key>\n is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.\n\n\nExample: \ncontext.set(\"code\",code)\n       \n\n\nUserService.instance()\n          \n\nGets the user login instance      \n\n\nServerUtil.getFirstValue():\n         \n\nTo access  information from \nrequestParameters\n in your script with \nServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)\n where \n<key>\n\nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method \nrequestParameters.get(\"<key>\")\n\nwhere \n<key>\n specifies the value you want to retrieve .     \n\n\nuserService.getUserByAttribute():\n   \n\n\ngetUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)\n method accesses information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the \n<Key>\n.      \n\n\nExample: \nuserService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)\n       \n\n\ngetAttribute():\n    \n\nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP, \ngetAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\")\n can be used. \n\n\nExample: \ngetAttribute(\"mobile\")\n     \n\n\nrequestParameters.get():\n      \n\n\nrequestParameters.get(<key>)\n can be used to retrieve values passed from the form through the headers. This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where \n<key>\n is the value to be retrieved from header.\n\n\nExample: \nabc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()\n        \n\n\ngetCountAuthenticationSteps():\n       \n\nAnother method usually needed to implement is \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n. This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy, where the number of steps depends on the context. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCheck the \nDuo script\n \nfor a good example of how \ngetCountAuthenticationSteps\n can be used to implement adaptive authentication. The Duo script is scripted so that two-factor authentication is only presented for users in the IT group. The script checks for group membership and dynamically adjusts the number of steps. This can be implemented to check for any logic or attribute during the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".\n\n\n\n\ngetExtraParametersForStep():\n   \n\nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the \ngetExtraParametersForStep\n method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless, clustered two-step authentications.      \n\n\ngetPageForStep():\n     \n\nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive login, or even a custom first page, you'll need to implement the\n\ngetPageForStep\n method to specify the page you want to return for a given step.       \n\n\nsession_attributes.get():\n      \n\nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using \ncontext.set\n. This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the \nSessionState\n parameters which is defined in the code or program as \nsession_attributes.get(<key>)\n, where \n<key>\n is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.     \n\n\nExample: \nsession_attributes.get(\"code\")\n        \n\n\nSaving and Passing Values\n#\n\n\nSaving Values:\n#\n\n\ncontext.set\n can be used to save values of the required key to an attribute temporarily and the created temporary attribute will be alive only for limited time and expires and gets removed, by that way, adding new attribute to the user is not messed up. And also the expired attribute kills the validity of the session and becomes invalid.       \n\n\nRetriving and passing values between steps\n#\n\n\nUsing \nsession_attribute.get()\n method, stored session attribute can be retrieved anywhere between the authentication method, enabling values to be passed between multiple authentication methods for verification and validation.

In an interception script you can call external APIs, like a commercial authentication service, a DDoS protection service, a fraud detection service, etc., to make your authentication process more secure. In addition, interception scripts give you the ability to implement business driven policies during authentication.   For example, you may want to only prompt users in a certain group for two-factor authentication. Or, you may want to only prompt a user for two-factor authentication if the request is coming from an unknown IP address. These types of policies can be incorporated into your authentication service by writing an interception script that uses the  methods  described below.  This tutorial explains how to write a script to implement a two-step out-of-band authentication using Twilio to send an SMS with a one-time password. At the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of how to write your own custom scripts. For reference, you can review the completed Twilio custom authentication script  here .",

            "text": "authenticate():      \nThe most important method to implement is the  authenticate  method. This is where the main business logic is located for\nthe authentication workflow. It is possible to switch on the step, with the  if (step == 1):  statement. In oxAuth, there is no\nassumption that step 1 and step 2 happen on the same server, therefore the value is stored in LDAP using a temporarily created attribute that can be retrieved in step 2. The step is sent to the  authenticate  method, which helps to save and retrieve the values as required.  Below are a few Methods and Libraries used to Save the Value to LDAP and retrieve the values as required:  random.randit()      random.randit(\"start number\",\"\"end number\")  Generates the code as required.       Example:  random.randit(10000,99999)  context.set()     \nThis particular method is obtained from jboss to pass the session attribute value to LDAP by creating a temporary attribute which has a limited lifetime and can be retrieved within the life span, otherwise it expires and the session becomes invalid. Save the value of the code obtained through the code generator method.  context.set(\"Name of the temp attribute\", <key>)  where  <key>  is the value that needs to be stored temporarily in ldap.  Example:  context.set(\"code\",code)          UserService.instance()            \nGets the user login instance        ServerUtil.getFirstValue():           \nTo access  information from  requestParameters  in your script with  ServerUtil.getFirstValue(requestParameters, <key>)  where  <key> \nspecifies the value you want to retrieve, you can also use another method  requestParameters.get(\"<key>\") \nwhere  <key>  specifies the value you want to retrieve .       userService.getUserByAttribute():      getUserByAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute\", <key>)  method accesses information in LDAP and retrieves the value of the attribute comparing the value of the  <Key> .        Example:  userService.getUserByAttribute(\"uid\", user_name)          getAttribute():      \nTo retrieve the value of an attribute from LDAP,  getAttribute(\"LDAP Attribute name\")  can be used.   Example:  getAttribute(\"mobile\")        requestParameters.get():         requestParameters.get(<key>)  can be used to retrieve values passed from the form through the headers. This will retrieve the values from the form via header and can be stored in a string. Where  <key>  is the value to be retrieved from header.  Example:  abc = requestParameters.get(\"passcode\")[0].strip()           getCountAuthenticationSteps():         \nAnother method usually needed to implement is  getCountAuthenticationSteps . This method normally just returns 1, 2, or 3. If implementing an adaptive authentication strategy, where the number of steps depends on the context.    Note  Check the  Duo script  \nfor a good example of how  getCountAuthenticationSteps  can be used to implement adaptive authentication. The Duo script is scripted so that two-factor authentication is only presented for users in the IT group. The script checks for group membership and dynamically adjusts the number of steps. This can be implemented to check for any logic or attribute during the authentication, like \"country\" or \"region\".   getExtraParametersForStep():     \nIf required to save session variables between steps, use the  getExtraParametersForStep  method. The Gluu Server persists\nthese variables in LDAP in able to support stateless, clustered two-step authentications.        getPageForStep():       \nIf required to display a special Web page for an interactive login, or even a custom first page, you'll need to implement the getPageForStep  method to specify the page you want to return for a given step.         session_attributes.get():        \nThe attribute value that are saved by the session using  context.set . This method is derived from the oxauth core java libraries and called using the  SessionState  parameters which is defined in the code or program as  session_attributes.get(<key>) , where  <key>  is the session atribute value that is stored in the ldap.

SAML1 URI:  This field can contain a SAML v1 supported nameformat for the new attribute. If this field is left blank the Gluu Server will automatically populate a value.     SAML2 URI:  This field can contain a SAML v2 supported nameformat for the new attribute. If this field is left blank the Gluu Server will automatically populate a value.     Display Name:  The display name can be anything that is human readable.    Type:  Select what type of attribute is being added in this field. The Gluu Server supports four types of attributes: text, numeric, photo, and date. Choose the option that best applies.     Edit Type:  This field controls who can edit this attribute. If  user  is selected, this will enable each user to edit this attribute in their Gluu server user profile (assuming oxTrust is user facing, and the \"User can edit own profile\" feature has been enabled).    View Type:  This field controls which type of an user is allowed to view\n  corresponding attribute at his/her \"Profile\" page of the web UI.    Multivalued:  If the attribute contains more than one value, set this field to True.     oxAuth claim name:  If this attribute will be used as a 'claim' in your OpenID Connect service, add the name of the claim here. Generally, the name of the attribute == name of the claim.    SCIM Attributes:  If the attribute is a part of your SCIM architecture, set this field to True.    Enable custom validation for this attribute:  If you plan to set minimum and maximum lengths or a regex pattern, as described below, you will need to enable custom validation for this attribute. Otherwise you can leave this disabled.     Enable tooltip for this attribute:  This allows you to set a tool tip for the attribute.     Minimum Length:  This is the minimum length of a value associated with this attribute.     Maximum Length:  This is the maximum length of a value associated with this attribute.     Regex Pattern:  You can set a regex pattern to enforce proper formatting of an attribute. For example, you could set a regex expression for an email attribute like this:  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\\\\.[A-Z]{2,6}$ . This would make sure that a value is added for the attribute only if it follows standard email formatting.    Status:  Mark the attribute as Active so that it can be used in your federation service.

            "text": "User Management in Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nYou can either \"push\" or \"pull\" identity data to the Gluu server to keep \nit up-to-date with the latest user claims. In the \"pull\" mode, otherwise known as LDAP Synchronization or Cache Refresh, the Gluu Server can use one or more existing LDAP identity sources (like Microsoft Active Directory) as the authoritative source of identity information. To \"push\" identities to the Gluu Server you can use the JSON/REST SCIM API. Local user management can also be performed inside oxTrust. Each method is detailed below.\n\n\nLocal User Management\n#\n\n\nIn oxTrust, you can add, edit and manage people, groups and user\nattributes and claims to ensure the proper information is released about\nthe right people.\n\n\nManage People\n#\n\n\nTo manage people, navigate to \nUser\n > \nManage People\n.\n\n\nFrom this interface you can add and search users. Because the user database can potentially be very large, a value is required in the search field. In other words, you can not click search with a blank entry to populate all users. If you need to see all users, this would be best performed manually within the Gluu LDAP server. Upon performing a user search in oxTrust a list will be populated with all users that match the search.\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a user, simply click on any of the hyperlinks associated with\nthat user and you will be taken to a user management interface where you\ncan modify specific attributes relating to that user.\n\n\n\n\nManage Groups\n#\n\n\nOut of the box, the Gluu Server includes one group: the Gluu Manager\nGroup (\ngluuManager\n). Groups can be added and populated as\nneeded. By using the \nManage Groups\n feature, the Gluu Server\nAdministrator can add, delete or modify any group or user within a\ngroup. The list of available groups can be viewed by hitting the\n\nSearch\n button with a blank search box.\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server Administrator can modify information such as Display\nName, Group Owner, Visibility type etc. The Server Administrator can\nalso add or delete users within existing groups. The group information\nis represented as shown below.\n\n\n\nIf any member of the Organization is required to be added in any\nspecific group, this can be achieved be clicking on the Add Member\nbutton. The flow is \nAdd Member --> Search the name/email of the user\n--> Select the user --> Click OK --> Update.\n\n\n\n\nImport People\n#\n\n\nGluu Server allows the administrator to import users from a file. This can be accessed by navigating to \nUsers\n > \nImport People\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd\n button to select the file from which the users will be imported. This feature has been tested with a \nxls\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file needs to be validated before it can be imported. Click on the \nValidate\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nImport\n button to complete the import of users.\n\n\n\n\nFile Structure\n#\n\n\nThe file needs to contain the following fields from which the user data will be pulled. Please remember to use the exact spelling as shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Registration\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server is shipped with a very basic user registration feature. The registration page can typically be found at \nhttps://<hostname>/identity/register\n. It's important to note that when user registration is handled via oxTrust, the users can \nnot\n be added to a backend LDAP or Active Directory server. This means that self-registration via oxTrust is only effective if users are authenticated by GluuLDAP (and not a backend LDAP or AD server).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nWhen possible, we recommend handling user registration in your app locally, then pushing the user information to the Gluu Server via SCIM. This will give you more control and flexibility in defining the exact registration process. Also, since it was primarily designed as an interface for admins, frequently oxTrust is not Internet facing.\n\n\n\n\nA limited number of attributes are present in the default registration form. If more attributes are needed they can be added via the GUI by navigating to \nOrganization Configuration\n > \nManage Registration\n. Learn how to \nadd attributes\n to the default registration form. \n\n\nUser Registration Custom Script\n#\n\n\nThe \nUser Registration\n custom script can be used to control and validate user registrations. In the oxTrust GUI, navigate to \nConfiguration\n > \nManage Custom Scripts\n > \nUser Registration\n. \n\n\n\n\nSet the \nenable_user\n value to \ntrue\n so that the user can login as soon as the registration is complete. If you want to manually review and approve new user registrations, you can leave this value set to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nEnable\n checkbox at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\nNow users should be able to self-register through the user registration link, which should be available at \n<hostname>/identity/register\n.\n\n\n\n\nLDAP Synchronization\n#\n\n\nLDAP Synchronization, a.k.a. Cache Refresh, is the process of connecting one or more existing backend LDAP servers, like Microsoft Active Directory, with the Gluu Server's local LDAP server. Synching people and attributes from a backend server speeds up authentication transactions. It is possible to perform attribute transformations, changing the name of attributes, or even using an interception script to change the values. Transformations are stored in the Gluu LDAP service. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are synching user information from multiple backend servers (AD or LDAP) simultaneously, the backend tree structure should be identical.\n\n\n\n\nVideo Tutorial\n#\n\n\nFor a guided video overview of configuring Cache Refresh, please watch the following three videos:  \n\n- \nPart 1: What is 'Cache Refresh' and How Does it Work?\n   \n\n- \nPart 2: Configuring Cache Refresh in the Gluu Server\n  \n\n- \nPart 3: Managing Authentication After You've Setup Cache Refresh\n    \n\n\nThings To Remember\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports two LDAP modes: \n\n\n\n\nAuthentication \n\n\nIdentity mapping\n\n\n\n\nOnly sometimes is it the same LDAP server. To synchronize user accounts from an external LDAP directory server, you can use the built-in oxTrust features for Cache Refresh, which supports mapping identities from one or more source directory servers.\n\n\nAfter configuring Cache Refresh, you should give it some time to run and populate the LDAP server. Here are some tips before you get started:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable 'Keep External Person' during CR setup. This will allow your\n  default user 'admin' to log into Gluu Server after initial Cache \n  Refresh iteration. If you do not enable 'Keep External Person', your \n  'admin' user including all other test users will be gone after first \n  Cache Refresh iteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you are using LDAP authentication, not VDS. You will only\n  need VDS setting if you are using the Radiant Logic Virtual Directory\n  Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the snapshots folder to see if files are being created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the oxTrust admin to browse users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the command \nldapsearch\n to check to see if results are starting\n  to come in. The following command will search for the total number of\n  users in the Gluu LDAP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# /opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -Z -X -D \"cn=directory manager\" -w 'pass_of_ldap_ -b 'ou=people,o=DA....,o=gluu' dn | grep \"dn\\:\" | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to login with one of these users. We assume that you have also\n  setup your Gluu Server to use the correct LDAP server for\n  authentication.\n\n\n\n\nThings To Know\n#\n\n\nThe deployer needs to know various values of the backend AD to\nconfigure Cache Refresh. For example, host & port, bindDN user information,\nbindDN password, Objectclasses, attributes which will be\npulled etc.\n\n\nIn addition, the deployer needs to know generic information about the\nGluu Server's LDAP. By default, the deployer can use \nlocalhost:1636\n,\n\ncn=directory manager\n, \npassword\n chosen during installation,\n\nou=people,o=site\n as server information, \nbindDN\n, \nbindDN password\n and\n\nbaseDN\n respectively.\n\n\nAfter collecting this information, the deployer can move forward with\nthe Cache Refresh setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Run:\n The date and time of the latest cache refresh cycle\n  completion is shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates at the Last Run:\n This shows the total number of users who\n  have been updated in the last Cache Refresh cycle. For example an user\n  who has any of his attribute updated will show up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem at the Last Run:\n This shows the number of users who have\n  been rejected by the Gluu Server during the update. If there are any\n  rejections, please contact Gluu Support for clarification and help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Backend Key and Attributes\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Attribute:\n This is the unique key attribute of backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP Server such as SAMAccountname for any Active Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Class:\n This contains the Object Classes of the backend Active\n  Directory/LDAP which has permission to talk to Gluu Server Cache Refresh\n  such as person, organizationalPerson, user etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Attribute:\n This contains the list of attributes which will be\n  pulled and read by the Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom LDAP Filter:\n If there is any custom search required, this\nfiltering mechanism can be used such as \"sn=*\" whereas the value of this\nfield ensures that every user must contain an attribute named SN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource Backend LDAP Servers\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section allows the Gluu Server to connect to the backend Active\nDirectory/LDAP server of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName:\n Please input \nsource\n as the value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Anonymous Bind:\n Some customers do now allow username/password\n  connections to their backend server. Enable this option if this applies\n  to your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBind DN:\n This contains the username to connect to the backend\n  server. You need to use full DN here. As for example,\n  \ncn=gluu,dc=company,dc=org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse SSL:\n Use this feature if the backend server allows SSL\n  connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Connections:\n This value defines the maximum number of\n  connections that are allowed to read the backend Active Directory/LDAP\n  server. It is recommended to keep the value of 2 or 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer:\n This contains the backend Active Directory/LDAP server\n  hostname with port i.e. backend.organization.com:389. If organization\n  has a failover server, click \nAdd Server\n and add more hostnames with\n  port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase DN:\n This contains the location of the Active Directory/LDAP\n  tree from where the Gluu Server shall read the user information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n This check-box is used to save and push the changes. Do not\n  use this unless the server administrator has entered all the required\n  values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Bind Password:\n This can be used for a new password or to\n  change any existing password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your organization has a multiple Active Directory/LDAP server, click\non \nAdd source LDAP server\n and add the additional server information.\nPlease remember that a \nfailover server\n is not a new server.\n\n\nInum LDAP Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nThis section of the application allows the server administrator to\nconnect to the internal LDAP of the Gluu Server. As Gluu Server\nadministrator, you do not need to insert anything here in this section\nas new Gluu Server versions automatically populates this for you (unless\nyou try to manually configure it anyway).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh Method:\n The Gluu Server allows the Server Administrator to\n  apply two types of Cache Refresh mechanism--(i) VDS Method and (ii) Copy\n  Method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVDS Method:\n Any organization with a database like \nmysql\n can use\n  the VDS method. This option can be enabled via the drop-down menu in\n  Refresh Method option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Method:\n If the organization has any kind of Active\n  Directory/LDAP server, they are strongly recommended to use the \nCopy\n  Method\n from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttributes Mapping\n#\n\n\nWhen the Copy method is selected, a section for Attribute mapping will\nbe exposed. In this section, the Gluu Server Administrator can map any\nattribute from the backend Active Directory/LDAP to the LDAP cache of\nthe Gluu Server.\n\n\n\n\nIn the source attribute to destination attribute mapping field, you can\nenter the source attribute value on the left, and the destination\nattribute on the right. In other words, you can specify what the\nattribute is on the backend in the left field, and what it should be\nrendered as when it comes through the Gluu Server in the right field.\n\n\nThe Administrator can select any Cache Refresh Method according to the\nbackend Active Directory/LDAP server, but there are some essential\nvalues for both types of cache refresh method. The values are given\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPooling Interval (Minutes):\n This is the interval value for running\n    the Cache Refresh mechanism in the Gluu Server. It is recommended to \n    be kept higher than 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript File Name:\n The Gluu Server cache refresh can accept any\n    kind of Jython Script which might help to calculate any custom/complex\n    attribute i.e. eduPersonScopedAffiliation. For more information please\n    contact Gluu Support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Folder:\n Every cycle of of Gluu Server Cache Refresh cycle\n    saves an overall snapshot and problem-list record on a specified\n    location. This is where the Gluu Server Administrator can specify the\n    location. You can easily decide whether cache refresh synchronizes all\n    users or not. Generally the rejected users are enclosed in the\n    problem-list file. An overall report is displayed at the top of the\n    cache refresh page with headings \nUpdated at the last run\n and\n    \nProblems at the last run\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot Count:\n This defines the total number of snapshots that\n    are allowed to be saved in the hard drive of the VM. It is recommended\n    to be kept to 20 snapshots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Gluu Servers (including Community Edition) introduced two\nupgraded sections here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer IP Address:\n Include the IP of your Gluu Server here. This\n    feature helps to run Cache Refresh mechanism perfectly in a clustered\n    environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved Script File Name location:\n New version of the Gluu Server\n    allows the administrator to manage your custom scripts with more\n    interactive section under configuration named Manage Custom Scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n This button is used to push the changes in the Gluu\n    Server.

After configuring Cache Refresh, you should give it some time to run and populate the LDAP server. Here are some tips before you get started:    Enable 'Keep External Person' during CR setup. This will allow your\n  default user 'admin' to log into Gluu Server after initial Cache \n  Refresh iteration. If you do not enable 'Keep External Person', your \n  'admin' user including all other test users will be gone after first \n  Cache Refresh iteration.

            "text": "SAML\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nSAML is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging \nauthentication and authorization data between an identity provider \n(like the Gluu Server) and a service provider (like Dropbox, O365, etc.). \nSAML is a stable and mature standard, and is well supported at many of the \nInternet's largest domains. However, the last major release of SAML was in 2005! \nTherefore it is important to understand when to use SAML and when to use a \nnewer protocol like OpenID Connect to achieve your identity goals. \n\n\nRefer to these four considerations to determine which protocol \nto use for single sign-on (SSO):\n\n\n\n\nIf you have an application that already supports SAML, use SAML.\n\n\nIf you need to support user login at an external IDP (like a customer or partner IDP), use SAML.\n\n\nIf you have a mobile application, use OpenID Connect.\n\n\nIf you are writing a new application, use OpenID Connect.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are continuing with the SAML documentation it is presumed your use case aligns with one or both of the first two bullet points above. If not, we recommend that you review the \nOpenID Connect\n portion of the Gluu Server docs. \n\n\nOutbound vs. Inbound SAML\n#\n\n\nThere are two main SAML authentication workflows: outbound SAML and inbound SAML. \n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. \nIn an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) redirects a user to a \ndesignated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. \nThe IDP asks for the user's credentials and upon successful authentication redirects the user to the protected content. \n\n\nInbound SAML enables an organization to offer SAML authentication as a front door to their digital service. Inbound SAML is a common requirement for SaaS providers who need to support the authentication requirements of large enterprise customers.\n\n\nThe typical user flow for inbound SAML is as follows: \n\n\n\n\nUser tries to access your protected resource;    \n\n\nUser is redirected to a discovery page (presented by your IDP) that presents one or more external IDP's where the user may have an existing identity (their \"home IDP\");   \n\n\nUser selects their home IDP and is sent for authentication;   \n\n\nUpon successful authentication at their home IDP, user is redirected back to your service with access to the protected resource. \n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server bundles separate components to support both workflows (installation of each component is optional during Gluu Server deployment):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor outbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the \nShibboleth SAML IDP\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor inbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the \nAsimba SAML Proxy\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation for each service follows in the sections below. \n\n\nOutbound SAML (Shibboleth)\n#\n\n\nOutbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) \nor traditional SAML. In an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) \nredirects a user to a designated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication \nand authorization. The IDP will ask for the user's credentials and upon successful \nauthentication, the user is sent back to the SP logged in. \n\n\nIn order for this transaction to happen successfully there must be pre-established \ntrust between the IDP and the SP. In the Gluu Server, the IDPs SSO configuration is \ncalled a Trust Relationship (TR). The following sections cover how to create a TR in the Gluu Server. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor any outbound SAML transaction, a trust relationship must be created in the IDP.\n\n\n\n\nTrust Relationship Requirements\n#\n\n\nEach Trust Relationship requires the infomation listed below.\n\n\nMetadata of the SP\n     \n\nMetadata is an XML file which has configuration data used to establish trust between the website (SP) and IDP (Gluu Server). Websites (SP) can provide metadata via a URL or as a separate file. Metadata can change, so a static URL typically requires the least amount of ongoing maintenance. \n\n\nMetadata of the Gluu Server\n     \n\nThe Gluu Server's SAML metadata may be needed from time to time. It can be found at \nhttps://hostname/idp/shibboleth\n.\n\n\nAttribute Release\n    \n\nEach SP may require one or more user attributes in order to grant a person access to a protected resource. Required attributes vary depending on the application, and should be explicitly listed in the target application's documentation. The Gluu Server ships with \ncertain preconfigured attributes and also supports the creation of custom attributes. Once the attributes are available in the Gluu Server, the administrator can use the oxTrust interface to release the necessary attributes to the SP (as described \nbelow\n). For a broader discussion of attributes, including how to create custom attributes, check the \nattributes section\n of the documentation.\n\n\nNameID\n#\n\n\nThe default NameID for oxTrust generated SAML trust relationships is \ntransientID\n. It's always a good idea to release the \ntransientID\n as an attribute, as some SP's may not work otherwise. If there are other \nNameID\n requirements, a custom attribute must be created in oxTrust first before defining it as the \nNameID\n. Please review the \ncustom attributes\n section of the docs to learn how to create custom attributes in oxTrust.\n\n\nDefining NameID\n#\n\n\nThe template file for \nNameID\n definitions are located in the \nattribute-resolver.xml.vm\n file under \n/opt/gluu/jetty/identity/conf/shibboleth3/idp/\n.\n  The example below adds \ntestcustomattribute\n as \nNameID\n based on UID attribute. The following are put into the \nattribute-resolver.xml.vm\n file.\n\n\n\n\nAdd declaration for the new attribute\n  \nif( ! ($attribute.name.equals('transientId') or $attribute.name.equals('testcustomattribute') ) )\n\n\nAdd definition for the new attribute\n\n\n\n\n <resolver:AttributeDefinition id=\"testcustomattribute\" xsi:type=\"Simple\"\n                              xmlns=\"urn:mace:shibboleth:2.0:resolver:ad\"\n                              sourceAttributeID=\"email\">\n\n        <resolver:Dependency ref=\"siteLDAP\"/>\n        <resolver:AttributeEncoder xsi:type=\"SAML2StringNameID\"\n                                xmlns=\"urn:mace:shibboleth:2.0:attribute:encoder\"\n                                nameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:email\" />\n</resolver:AttributeDefinition> \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate /opt/shibboleth-idp/conf/saml-nameid.xml to generate SAML 2 NameID content\n\n\n\n\n    <bean parent=\"shibboleth.SAML2AttributeSourcedGenerator\" \n          p:format=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:email\"\n          p:attributeSourceIds=\"#{ {'testcustomattribute'} }\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart identity service using below command\n\n\n\n\nservice identity restart\n \n\n\nHowever it is recommended to stop and start service using \n\n\nservice identity stop\n\n\nservice identity start\n\n\nCreate a Trust Relationship in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nSAML\n > \nTrust Relationships\n\n\nClick on \nAdd Trust Relationship\n\n\nA new page will appear where you can provide all the required information to create a Trust\n  Relationship(TR).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n: Name of the Trust Relationship (it should be unique for every trust relationship)     \n\n\nDescription\n: Little description. Purpose and SSO link can be added here.    \n\n\n\n\nMetadata Type\n: There are four available options to choose from. The correct Type depends on how the SP is delivering Metadata to your IDP.      \n\n\n\n\nFile\n: Choose File if the SP has provided an uploadable metadata document in XML format.\n\n\nURI\n: Chose URI if the SP metadata is hosted on a URI that is accessible from the Internet.\n\n\nGenerate\n: Choose Generate if the SP is an \"inhouse application\" or the \u201cShibboleth SP\u201d is going to be installed in the target application (SP). This option will generate a how-to guide for installing the Shibboleth SP. If you plan on using the Generate method, please note the following:        \n\n        * \nURL\n : This is the hostname of the SP.   \n\n        * \nPublic certificate\n : You must provide the certificate, which is a Base64 encoded ASCII file, and contain \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\". This certificate \ncan not\n be password protected.             \n\n        * After creating the Trust Relationship, download the generated configuration files from the \nDownload Shibboleth2 configuration files\n link and place these configuration files inside your SP configuration.         \n\n\nFederation\n: Choose this option if the target application (SP) is affiliated with a federation service (e.g. InCommon, NJEdge etc.). Once you select \u201cFederation\u201d as the Metadata Type, another drop down menu called \u201cSelect Federation\u201d will appear. From this drop menu you can select the appropriate federation. After selecting the \u201cFederation Name\u201d, a new link called \u201cClick to select\nentity id\u201d will appear. Use this link to find and select the SP entityIDs that you wish to create SSO with. Learn how to establish trust with a federation \nbelow\n.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased\n: The SPs required attributes must be added to this panel. The required attributes can be selected from the menu on the left with the heading \u201cRelease Additional Attributes\u201d.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trust Relationship(TR) is added by clicking the \nAdd\n button located in the lower left side of the page.     \n\n\nRelying Party Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support SAML, the Relying Party software must be configured. The relying party configuration is accessible on the TR Creation page. The checkbox \nConfigure specific Relying Party\n must be checked.     \n\n\n     \n\n\nThe checkbox will result in a link which can be accessed to find information about configuring the relying party for the TR. The image below shows the relying party config panel from which the administrator can add the specific option.     \n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the target application does not already support a federation standard like SAML, and you or the developer are planning on adding federation to the application, we strongly recommend using OpenID Connect rather than SAML. OpenID Connect is newer, easier to use, and follows modern best practices. Learn more in our blog: \nOAuth vs. SAML vs. OpenID Connect\n.\n\n\n\n\nFederation Configuration\n#\n\n\nIf the SP is part of an identity federation such as InCommon, the administrator must add the federation as an SP in the Gluu Server. This will enable the administrator to more easily create TRs with SPs in the federation. The example below shows how an administrator would add a TR for the InCommon Federation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce a TR has been established with the federation, the Gluu Server administrator can easily create TRs with any SP included in the federation by selecting the federation from the \nFederation Name\n drop down menu and selecting the entity-id for the SP. As for example here we are creating 'Internet2 Wiki' Trust Relationship which is InCommon affiliated ( that means, SP's entityID is available in InCommon metadata ). \n\n\n\n\nInbound SAML (Asimba)\n#\n\n\nInbound SAML allows users from external domains to login at their home identity provider to gain access to resources protected by the Gluu Server. The Gluu Server uses an open source product called \nAsimba\n to normalize inbound SAML. \n\n\nThe following documentation provides a step-by-step guide for configuring Asimba with two (2) IDPs and a single (1) SP. The guide includes use of a SAML interception script which is shipped with the Gluu Server and simplifies the process of using Asimba. The administrator can add multiple IDPs or SPs (as required) using the method outlined below. Each SP and IDP must be connected to the IDP that has the Asimba module enabled.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA description of the SAML interception script is available \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Setup\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup hostname\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://sp.gluu.org/protected/print.py\n\n\nThis is a shibboleth SP connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a Gluu Server with Asimba installed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://nest.gluu.org\n\n\nThis is a second Gluu Server with Shibboleth installed that is connected to \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gluu Server with hostname \nhttps://test.gluu.org\n must include Asimba.

However, the last major release of SAML was in 2005! \nTherefore it is important to understand when to use SAML and when to use a \nnewer protocol like OpenID Connect to achieve your identity goals.   Refer to these four considerations to determine which protocol \nto use for single sign-on (SSO):   If you have an application that already supports SAML, use SAML.  If you need to support user login at an external IDP (like a customer or partner IDP), use SAML.  If you have a mobile application, use OpenID Connect.  If you are writing a new application, use OpenID Connect.   If you are continuing with the SAML documentation it is presumed your use case aligns with one or both of the first two bullet points above. If not, we recommend that you review the  OpenID Connect  portion of the Gluu Server docs.",

Outbound SAML can also be called SP-initiated Single Sign-On (SSO) or traditional SAML. \nIn an outbound SAML transaction a website or application (SP) redirects a user to a \ndesignated Identity Provider (IDP) for authentication and authorization. \nThe IDP asks for the user's credentials and upon successful authentication redirects the user to the protected content.   Inbound SAML enables an organization to offer SAML authentication as a front door to their digital service. Inbound SAML is a common requirement for SaaS providers who need to support the authentication requirements of large enterprise customers.  The typical user flow for inbound SAML is as follows:    User tries to access your protected resource;      User is redirected to a discovery page (presented by your IDP) that presents one or more external IDP's where the user may have an existing identity (their \"home IDP\");     User selects their home IDP and is sent for authentication;     Upon successful authentication at their home IDP, user is redirected back to your service with access to the protected resource.    The Gluu Server bundles separate components to support both workflows (installation of each component is optional during Gluu Server deployment):    For outbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the  Shibboleth SAML IDP .     For inbound SAML, the Gluu Server bundles the  Asimba SAML Proxy .     Documentation for each service follows in the sections below.",

            "text": "OpenID Connect\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect is an identity layer that profiles and extends OAuth 2.0. \nIt defines a sign-in flow that enables an application (client) to \nauthenticate a person, and to obtain authorization to obtain \ninformation (or \"claims\") about that person. For more information, \nsee \nhttp://openid.net/connect\n\n\nIt's handy to know some OpenID Connect terminology:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nend user\n or \nsubject\n is the person being authenticated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Provider\n or \nOP\n is the equivalent of the SAML IDP. It \nholds the credentials (like a username/ password) and information about \nthe subject. The Gluu Server is an OP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nRelying Party\n or  \nRP\n is software, like a mobile application \nor website, which needs to authenticate the subject. The RP is an OAuth \nclient. \noxd\n is an RP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead \nthis blog\n for a good overview of OpenID Connect versus SAML.\n\n\nOpenID Connect in the Gluu Server\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server passes all \nOpenID Provider conformance profiles\n. \nIt supports the all the current specifications: Core, Dynamic Client \nRegistration, Discovery, Form Post Response Mode, Session Management, \nand the draft for Front Channel Logout.\n\n\nOpenID Connect Flows\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server supports all flows defined in the Core spec, including\nimplicit, code, and hybrid. The implicit flow, where the token and\nid_token are returned from the authorization endpoint, should only \nbe used for applications that run in the browser, like a Javascript \nclient. The code flow or hybrid flow should be used for server side\napplications, where code on the web server can more securely call\nthe token endpoint to obtain a token. The most useful response type \nfor the hybrid flow is \"code id_token\". Using this flow, you can verify\nthe integrity of the code by inspecting the \nc_hash\n claim in the \nid_token.\n\n\nIf you are using the code flow, the response type should only be code.\nThere is no point in using response type \"code token id_token\"--the extra\ntokens returned by the authorization endpoint will only create additional\ncalls to the LDAP server and slow you down. If you are going to trade\nthe code at the token endpoint for a new token and id_token, you don't\nneed them from the authorization endpoint too.\n\n\nConfiguration / Discovery\n#\n\n\nA good place to start when you're learning about OpenID Connect is\nthe configuration endpoint, which is located in the Gluu Server\nat the following URL: \nhttps://hostname/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\nThe Gluu Server also supports \nWebFinger\n,\nas specified in the OpenID Connect specification. You can test Webfinger\nusing the oxAuth-RP tool mentioned above. For more information, see \nthe \nOpenID Connect Discovery Specification\n\n\nClient Registration / Configuration\n#\n\n\nOAuth clients need a client_id, and need to supply a login redirect uri--\nwhere the Authorization Server should redirect the end user to, post\nauthorization. The Gluu Server enables an administrator to manually create\na client via the oxTrust web interface. However, OpenID Connect also\ndefines a standard API where clients can register themselves--\n\nDynamic Client Registration\n. You can\nfind the registration URL by calling the configuration endpoint \n(\n/.well-known/openid-configuration\n).        \n\n\nYou may not want clients to dynamically register themselves! To disable\nthis endpoint, in the oxAuth JSON properties, set the \n\ndynamicRegistrationEnabled\n value to False.                 \n\n\nIf you want to add a client through oxTrust, you can use the manual form:\nby click the \nAdd Client\n button.            \n\n\n\n\nThere are many client configuration parameters. Most of these are \nspecified in the OpenID Connect \nDynamic Client Registration\n specification.\nThere are two configurations params which can only be configured via \noxTrust by an administrator. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Authorization -- Use this if you want to suppress the end user\n authorization prompt. This is handy for SSO scenarios where the clients\n are your own (not third party), and there is no need to prompt the \n person to approve the release of information.      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersist Client Authorizations -- Use this option if you only want \n to prompt the end user once to authorize the release of user \n information. It will cause the data to be persisted under the person's\n entry in the Gluu LDAP server.                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Client Registration\n#\n\n\nUsing the Client Registration custom interception scripts,\nyou can implement post-registration business logic. You have access to \nthe data that the client used to register. You could validate data, \npopulate extra client claim, or modify the scope registrations. You\ncould even call API's to determine if you want to allow the \nregistration at all. To access the interface for custom scripts in \noxTrust, navigate to Configuration --> Custom Scripts --> Client Registration.\n\n\n           \n\n\nThe script is \navailable here\n                      \n\n\nLogout\n#\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect \nSession Management\n specification is still marked as draft, and new mechanisms for logout are in the works. The current specification requires JavaScript to detect that the session has been ended in the browser. It works... unless the tab with the JavaScript happens to be closed when the logout event happens on another tab. Also, inserting JavaScript into every page is not feasible for some applications. \n\n\nThe Gluu Server also support the draft for \nFront Channel Logout\n. This\nis our recommended logout strategy. Using this mechanism, an html page is rendered which contains one iFrame for each application that \nneeds to be notified of a logout. The Gluu Server keeps track of which clients are associated with a session (i.e. your browser). This \nmechanism is not perfect. If the end user's web browser is blocking third party cookies, it may break front channel logout. Also, the Gluu Server has no record if the logout is successful--only the browser knows. This means that if the logout fails, it will not be logged or retried. The good thing about front channel logout is that the application can clear application cookies in the end user's browser. To use front channel logout, the client should register logout_uri's, or \nfrontchannel_logout_uri\n for clients using the Dynamic Client Registration API. \n\n\nScopes\n#\n\n\nIn OAuth, scopes are used to specify extents of access. For a sign-in \nflow like OpenID Connect, scopes end up corresponding to the release of\nuser claims. The Gluu Server supports the \n\nstandard scopes\n defined \nin the OpenID Connect specification. You can also define your own scopes,\nand map them to any user attributes which you have registered. \n\n\nTo add Scope and Claims in OpenID Connect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nConfiguration\n > \nOpenID Connect\n           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Add scope on the screen to the right          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will presented the screen below to the enter the Scope Details                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add more claims, simply click \"Add Claim\" and you will be presented\nwith the following screen:                     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Name\n\n\nName of the scope which will be displayed when searched\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nText that will be displayed to the end user during approval of the scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Type\n\n\nOpenID, Dynamic or OAuth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Scope\n\n\nIf True, the scope may be requested during Dynamic Client Registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Type \"OpenID\" specifies to the Gluu Server that this scope will\nbe used to map user claims; \"Dynamic\" specifies to the Gluu Server that\nthe scope values will be generated from the result of the Dynamic Scopes \ncustom interception script; \"OAuth\" specifies that the scope will have\nno claims, it will be meaningful to an external resource server. \n\n\nSpecifying a scope as \"Default\" means that a client can request it \nduring dynamic client registration. The only default scope is \nopenid\n, \nwhich is required by the OpenID Connect specification. You can always \nexplicitly release a scope to a certain client later on, but this will \nrequire some manual intervention by the Gluu Server admin.\n\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication for Clients\n#\n\n\nThe \nacr_values\n parameter is used to specify a specific \nworkflow for authentication. The value of this parameter, or the \n\ndefault_acr_values\n client metadata value, corresponds to the \n\"Name\" of a custom authentication script.\n\n\nOut-of-the-box supported \nacr\n values include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACR Value\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nu2f\n\n\nFIDO U2F Device\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuper_gluu\n\n\nMulti-factor authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduo\n\n\nDuo soft-token authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncert\n\n\nSmart card or web browser X509 personal certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncas\n\n\nExternal CAS server\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngplus\n\n\nGoogle+ authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTP\n\n\nOATH one time password\n\n\n\n\n\n\nasimba\n\n\nUse of the Asimba proxy for inbound SAML\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntwilio_sms\n\n\nUse of the Twilio Saas to send SMS one time passwords\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassport\n\n\nUse of the \nPassport component for social login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyubicloud\n\n\nYubico cloud OTP verification service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuaf\n\n\nexperimental support for the FIDO UAF protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasic_lock\n\n\nEnables lockout after a certain number of failures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasic\n\n\nSample script using local LDAP authentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenID Connect Client Software\n#\n\n\nAlthough you can use generic OAuth client libraries, you would have \nto write some extra code to take advantage of OpenID Connect's \nsecurity features. For example, there is no id_token in OAuth, so you \nwon't find any code for id_token validation in an OAuth library. A good \nOpenID Connect client will do much of the heavy lifting for you. \n\n\nJavaScript Client\n#\n\n\nA JavaScript client is one of the easiest ways to use OpenID Connect. \nGluu maintains a project called \nOpenID Implicit Client\n.\n\n\nYou'll have to add the client manually to the Gluu Server via the GUI. \nWhen completing the \nadd client\n form, you can use the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\nClient Name: Implicit Test Client\nresponse_type: token id_token\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nSubject Type: public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: token id_token\nGrant Types: implicit\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have registered the client in the Gluu Server, all you need to \ndo is update the \nclient_id\n, \nredirect_uri\n, and \nproviderInfo\n values \nin the login page html. Assuming you've checked out the project into a \nweb accessible folder, then navigate to the page and test! \n\n\nServer-Side libraries\n#\n\n\nMany applications are \"server-side\", meaning the web page displays \ncontent but most of the dynamic business logic resides on the web server. \nThe OpenID Foundation maintains a list of client libraries on \n\ntheir website\n. However, our \nexperience has been that the quality of these libraries varies widely. \nSome are not well documented, other are not updated frequently, and some \ndo not implement essential security features available in OpenID Connect. \nIn addition, if a wide array of client libraries are used it becomes \ndifficult to monitor and patch security vulnerabilities. For this reason, \nwe recommend that you use our OpenID Connect middleware software called \n\noxd\n.  \n\n\noxd is not open source, but it is very reasonably priced at $0.33 per \nday per server--or ~$10/month. The code is available on \n\nGitHub\n, and there are free \nopen source oxd libraries available for PHP, Java, Python, C#, Node, \nRuby, Perl and Go. There are also plugins available for several popular \nopen source applications.\n\n\nWatch the oxd demo\n.\n\n\nGet an oxd license for free\n\n\nWeb Server Plugins\n#\n\n\nA popular approach to protecting web applications is to use a web server \nfilter to intercept the request, and make sure the person using that \nconnection is authenticated and authorized. The web server with the filter \nmay directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. \nLeveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older \naccess management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager. \n\n\nOne of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the \napplication developer does not need to know that much about the \nsecurity protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, \nthe person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another \nadvantage is that the application security is administered by the system \nadministrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to \nmanage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code. \n\n\nOne of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written \nby Hans Zandbelt, called \nmod_auth_openidc\n. It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source. \n\n\nNote: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar \n\nLua implementation\n \nto make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS. \n\n\nAppAuth for Mobile Applications\n#\n\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to use Connect is to authenticate \npeople from a mobile application. The IETF draft \n\nOAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\n \nprovides an overview of an improved design for mobile security. In \naddition to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests \nthe use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can \nregister a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).\n\n\nIn 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation \ncalled AppAuth for \nAndroid\n \nand \niOS\n. The AppAuth projects \nalso include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that \nit was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app \ndevelopers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only \ndoes AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the \nsystem browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by \nleveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser \nto be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable \nan app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications \nto steal codes or tokens. Using this approach, mobile app developers can \nuse the authorization code or hybrid flow (as described earlier). \n\n\nThe Gluu Server is the only free open source OpenID Connect Provider \nthat currently supports AppAuth. \n\n\noxAuth RP\n#\n\n\nThe Gluu Server ships with an optional OpenID Connect RP web application, \nwhich is handy for testing.  It's called oxauth-rp. During Gluu Server \nsetup, you'll be asked if you want to install it--which you should on \na development environment. It will be deployed on \nhttps://<hostname>/oxauth-rp\n. \nUsing this tool you can exercise all of the OpenID Connect API's, \nincluding discovery, client registration, authorization, token, \nuserinfo, and end_session.",

The web server with the filter \nmay directly serve the application, or may proxy to a backend service. \nLeveraging the web server is a well established pattern, used by older \naccess management platforms like CA Siteminder and Oracle Access Manager.   One of the advantages of the web server filter approach is that the \napplication developer does not need to know that much about the \nsecurity protocols--if the request makes it through to the application, \nthe person has been authenticated and the request is authorized. Another \nadvantage is that the application security is administered by the system \nadministrators, not by developers. For example, it may be easier to \nmanage and audit apache configuration than to read a bunch of code.   One of the best OpenID Connect relying party implementations was written \nby Hans Zandbelt, called  mod_auth_openidc . It is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that authenticates users against an OpenID Connect Provider (OP). The software can be found on GitHub and is included in the package management system for several Linux distributions. There are binary packages available, and if you are good at compiling C code, you can build it yourself from the source.   Note: if you are an Nginx fan, there is a similar  Lua implementation  \nto make NGINX operate as an OpenID Connect RP or OAuth 2.0 RS.",

In \naddition to the security features of OpenID Connect, this draft suggests \nthe use of a PKCE and custom URI schemes (i.e. an application can \nregister a URI such as myapp:// instead of https://).  In 2016, Google released and then donated code to the OpenID Foundation \ncalled AppAuth for  Android  \nand  iOS . The AppAuth projects \nalso include sample applications. Simulataneously, Google announced that \nit was deprecating the use of WebViews--a strategy used by mobile app \ndevelopers which is vulnerable to malicious application code. Not only \ndoes AppAuth provide secure authentication, it enables SSO across the \nsystem browser and mobile applications. It accomplishes this by \nleveraging new operating system features that enable the system browser \nto be called by an application in an opaque view that does not enable \nan app developer to steal a person's credentials, or other applications \nto steal codes or tokens.

Different scopes can grant access to the same action. For example, a \"read\" action can be allowed with scope \"read\" or \"all\". For some actions the Resource Server (RS) may want multiple scopes at the same time. For instance, a \"read\" action should only be allowed if the authorization request includes the \"read\" \nand\n \"all\" scopes.

The \nsetup.properties.file\n contains the RS and RP JWKS in Base64 format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following command to extract OpenID SCIM RS and RP Client ID\n\ncat setup.properties.last | grep \"scim_rs_client_id\\|scim_rp_client_id\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UMA SCIM client requires JWKS, so the setup script extracts the JWKS from \nsetup.properties.last\n and puts it into the \n./output/scim-rp.jks\n file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n For versions before v2.4.4, the JWKS is put in the \n./output/scim-rp-openid-keys.json\n file instead.\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\n\n\nEnable SCIM from Organization Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxTrust SCIM UMA configuration is automatically updated while running \nthe \nsetup.py\n and the correct values are setup \nin the \noxtrust-config.json\n file.\n\n\n\n\n  \"umaIssuer\":\"https://%(hostname)s\",\n  \"umaClientId\":\"%(scim_rs_client_id)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyId\":\"\",\n  \"umaResourceId\":\"1447184268430\",\n  \"umaScope\":\"https://%(hostname)s/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/uma/scopes/scim_access\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStoreFile\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_fn)s\",\n  \"umaClientKeyStorePassword\":\"%(scim_rs_client_jks_pass_encoded)s\",\n\n\n\n\n\n\numaClientKeyId\n can be updated with the \nalias\n from \nscim-rp.jks\n file; if it is not updated, the first key from the file is used automatically.\n\n\n\n\nTesting SCIM UMA\n#\n\n\nThe following is a sample code that can be run to test the configured SCIM \nUMA Gluu CE. It uses \nSCIM-Client\n, \na Java library also developed by Gluu intended for client applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Maven, below is how to add SCIM-Client to your project:\n\n\n\n\n<repositories>\n  <repository>\n    <id>gluu</id>\n    <name>Gluu repository</name>\n    <url>http://ox.gluu.org/maven</url>\n  </repository>\n</repositories>\n...\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>gluu.scim.client</groupId>\n  <artifactId>SCIM-Client</artifactId>\n  <version>${scim.client.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with Release v2.4.2, an SCIM-Client must be used on a matching Gluu CE. For example, if you are running CE v2.4.4, you must also use SCIM-Client v2.4.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your domain's SSL certificate to the JRE's \ncacerts\n certificate key store where your client application will run. There are lots of articles around the Web on how to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply the UMA parameters and run the code. \nNOTE:\n If you have re-installed Gluu CE, please note that the UMA parameters / JWKS files are also regenerated. You must then rebuild your client code with \ntarget\n or \ntmp\n folders possibly cleared beforehand to avoid conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackage gluu.scim.client.dev.local;\n\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimClient;\nimport gluu.scim.client.ScimResponse;\nimport gluu.scim2.client.Scim2Client;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\nimport javax.xml.bind.JAXBException;\n\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonGenerationException;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingException;\n\npublic class TestScimClient {\n\n    private static void testScim1Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final ScimClient scimClient = ScimClient.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        ScimResponse response = scimClient.personSearch(\"uid\", \"admin\", MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM1 \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    private static void testScim2Uma(String domain, String umaMetaDataUrl, String umaAatClientId, String umaAatClientJksPath, String umaAatClientJksPassword, String umaAatClientKeyId) throws IOException, JsonGenerationException, JsonMappingException, JAXBException {\n\n        final Scim2Client scim2Client = Scim2Client.umaInstance(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n\n        String filter = \"userName eq \\\"admin\\\"\";\n        ScimResponse response = scim2Client.searchUsers(filter, 1, 1, \"\", \"\", null);\n        System.out.println(\"SCIM2: \" + response.getResponseBodyString());\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, JAXBException {\n\n        final String domain = \"https://c67.gluu.info/identity/seam/resource/restv1\";\n        final String umaMetaDataUrl = \"https://c67.gluu.info/.well-known/uma-configuration\";\n        final String umaAatClientId = \"@!A410.188A.95DD.EA5A!0001!3A1E.BAA5!0008!5870.A795\";\n\n        final String umaAatClientJksPath = \"D:\\\\Development\\\\test_data\\\\scim\\\\scim-rp.jks\";\n        final String umaAatClientJksPassword = \"secret\";\n        final String umaAatClientKeyId = \"\";\n\n        testScim1Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n        testScim2Uma(domain, umaMetaDataUrl, umaAatClientId, umaAatClientJksPath, umaAatClientJksPassword, umaAatClientKeyId);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIM 2.0 Test Mode (v2.4.4+)\n#\n\n\nStarting with CE v2.4.4, the \"test mode\" configuration will help developers test the SCIM 2.0 endpoints easier.

We have documentation for configuring the Gluu Server for SSO to a few popular SaaS applications like Google and Salesforce. If we do not have a guide for configuring the app in question, simply perform a Goolge search for \n<SaaS Provider> SAML\n or \n<SaaS Provider> OpenID Connect\n.

If no token is present, the Web server may re-direct the person, or return a meaningful code or message to the application. The guides in the Web Server Integrations section of the docs include instructions for using Apache and Nginx software we have confirmed to work against the Gluu Server. \n\n\nClient SDKs\n#\n\n\nThe other integration option is to call the federation APIs directly in your application.

            "text": "JavaScript\n#\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nThe following documentation demonstrates how to use Gluu's \nOpenID Connect JavaScript implicit client\n to send users from an single page vanilla JS app to the Gluu Server for authentication and authorization.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The code used for this client was forked from a JavaScript library written by Edmund Jay.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the JavaScript Implicit Client?\n#\n\n\nThis JavaScript client implements the \nOpenID Connect implicit flow\n. The Implicit Flow is mainly used by Clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language. The Access Token and ID Token are returned directly to the Client, which may expose them to the End-User and applications that have access to the End-User's User Agent. The Authorization Server does not perform Client Authentication.\n\n\nThe OpenID Connect Implicit Flow follows the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nClient prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.\n\n\nClient sends the request to the Authorization Server.\n\n\nAuthorization Server Authenticates the End-User.\n\n\nAuthorization Server obtains End-User Consent/Authorization.\n\n\nAuthorization Server sends the End-User back to the Client with an ID Token and, if requested, an Access Token.\n\n\nClient validates the ID token and retrieves the End-User's Subject Identifier.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nTo use this library, include the openidconnect.js dependency to your HTML page. You can get it from the Github CDN.\n\n\n<script src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/GluuFederation/openid-implicit-client/master/openidconnect.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n\nThe next steps for the installation are:\n\n\n\n\nSetting the provider and client configuration info through JSON objects;\n\n\nCalling the server \u2013 login;\n\n\nIn the callback page, callback.html, you will get ID Token back, so that you can put it into the cookie to handle the session.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n#\n\n\nSetting info and authentication\n#\n\n\nThe library works with clients manually registered and it also allows a dynamic client registration. Please remember that for security purposes, during manual client registration you should set a Redirect Login URI to the address of the web page you intend to deploy.\n\n\nThe first step for the configuration should be setting the client and provider info. The first one should be done through a JSON object.\n\n\nvar clientInfo = {\n                client_id : '(your-client-id)',\n                redirect_uri : 'https://(hostname)/login-callback.html'\n                };\n\n\n\n\nThe dynamic client registration is done by declaring a JSON object without the client_id. The redirect_uri is a mandatory information.\n\n\nvar clientInfo = {\n                redirect_uri : 'callback.html'\n                };\n\n\n\n\nThe provider info is retrieved by calling the function \nOIDC.discover()\n.\n\n\nvar providerInfo = OIDC.discover('https://idp.example.com/');\n\n\n\n\nThe following functions set the information previously declared:\n\n\nOIDC.setClientInfo( clientInfo );\nOIDC.setProviderInfo( providerInfo );\n\n\n\n\nAfter setting client and provider information we choose to save all that data in the \nsessionStorage\n so we can restore them later at the callback-page and for that we use the method \nstoreInfo\n.\n\n\nOIDC.storeInfo(providerInfo, clientInfo);\n\n\n\n\nStill regarding our \nsessionStorage\n, we choose to remove both nonce and state from previous session to avoid conflict of data.\n\n\nsessionStorage.removeItem('state');\nsessionStorage.removeItem('nonce');\n\n\n\n\nThe authentication homepage for this sample is composed by HTML tables to show our client information and the login request. The latest is a JSON object composed by all the information passed to the server authorization endpoint through the method \nlogin\n. This function is called on click of a button and its parameters are optional authentication request options. For our sample client this functionality is set as following:\n\n\n<button onClick=\"OIDC.login( {scope : 'openid profile email',\n                            response_type : 'token id_token'} );\"\n        type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-success\" >Authenticate</button>\n\n\n\n\nLogin page\n#\n\n\nThe login page of this sample is called \nlogin-callback.html\n and it basically prints the Id Token and User claims issued by the Identity Provider. As mentioned before, the URI for this page should be set as the redirect_uri of the client registered on the Gluu Server. The first step to manage the desired claims should be restoring the information saved on the sessionStorage. The function \nrestoreInfo\n not only retrieves the client and provider information but it also sets them once again as described in the previous section of this tutorial.\n\n\nOIDC.restoreInfo();\n\n\n\n\nIn order to print the id_token claims you should use the method \ngetValidIdToken\n. It gets the ID Token from the current page URL whose signature is verified and contents validated against the configuration data set during restoration. The first step to get the user claims is to get the Access Token that is also included in the current page URL. And it can be done by the method \ngetAccessToken\n. The next code lines of our sample login-callback page are the following:\n\n\nvar id_token = OIDC.getValidIdToken();\nvar access_token = OIDC.getAccessToken();\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have the ID Token and the Access Token, you are able to get the ID Token claims and the User claims. The first one is returned by the function \ngetIdTokenParts\n. The second one is a response for a HTTP request done by the method \ngetUserInfo\n to the userinfo_endpoint of our IP. Both information are parsed to JSON Objects.\n\n\nvar tokenClaims = JSON.parse(OIDC.getIdTokenParts(id_token)[1]);\nvar userInfoClaims = JSON.parse(OIDC.getUserInfo(access_token));\n\n\n\n\nFor our example we choose to present all data in HTML tables and to make things easier we created the function \nJSONObjToHTMLTable\n. So it is possible to call this method passing a JSON object as an argument and it will return a HTML string with the JSON in a table format.\n\n\nvar tokenClaimsHTMLString = JSONObjToHTMLTable(tokenClaims);\nvar userInfoClaimsHTMLString = JSONObjToHTMLTable(userInfoClaims);\n\n\n\n\nThe last code line in our login page sample is calling the \ndebug\n function. It prints in browser console the client information, provider information and the results to the verification and validation tests of the ID Token.\n\n\nOIDC.debug(true, id_token);\n\n\n\n\nDynamic client registration\n#\n\n\nIn case a client is not registered on Identity Provider yet it is possible to automatically register a new client. This library allows to dynamically register the client and proceed to the steps as described on the previous sections. In order to do that, you should just declare the \nclientInfo\n with the \nredirect_uri\n and omit a \nclient_id\n. The \nsetClientInfo\n method is responsible to check the existence of a \nclient_id\n and in case it is not declared the function will do the registration of a new client at the IP with the known \nredirect_uri\n. After the well-succeed registration the same function retrieve the \nclient_id\n parameter from this registered client and adds it to \nclientInfo\n. So to dynamically register a new client just declare \nredirect_uri\n of your \nclientInfo\n and call the method \nsetClientInfo\n afterwards.\n\n\nvar clientInfo = {\n                redirect_uri : 'https://(hostname)/login-callback.html'\n                };\nOIDC.setClientInfo( clientInfo );",

Point your browser at \nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\nYou should see a list of current environment variables. \n\n\nConfiguration of mod_auth_openidc\n#\n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nmod_auth_openidc\n module depends on the Ubuntu package \nlibjansson4\n: \n\n\n# apt-get install libjansson\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need the mod_auth_openidc and libjose packages which can \nbe downloaded from the \nReleases Page\n.\n\n\nFor example, at this time the current release is 2.1.3, so the command would be:\n\n\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# wget https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.1.3/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libcjose_0.4.1-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n# dpkg -i libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.1.3-1ubuntu1.trusty.1_amd64.deb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nGet the latest packages here: https://github.com/pingidentity/mod_auth_openidc/releases\n\n\n\n\nNote, if you like to build from source, you can clone the project at \nGithub Page\n\n\nNow you can enable the module\n\n\n# sudo a2enmod auth_openidc\n# sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nThere are two methods for client registration:\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Client Registration\n\n\nManual Client Registration\n\n\n\n\nFor this example, let's create the client manually in the Gluu Server.\nWhen you add the client, use the following parameters:\n\n\nName: mod_auth_openidc\nClient Secret: something-sufficiently-unguessable\nApplication Type: Web\nPre-Authorization: Enabled\nlogin uri: https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nSubject Type: Public\nScopes: openid, profile, email\nResponse Types: code\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a note of the \nclient_secret\n (you won't get to see it again)! You'll\nalso need the \nclient_id\n for the next step.\n\n\nInstall CGI script\n#\n\n\nThis cgi-script makes for a good test page! \n\n\n# vi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nThen paste in this code\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport os\n\nd = os.environ\nk = d.keys()\nk.sort()\n\nprint \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\"\n\nprint \"<HTML><Head><TITLE>Print Env Variables</TITLE></Head><BODY>\"\nprint \"<h1>Environment Variables</H1>\"\nfor item in k:\n    print \"<p><B>%s</B>: %s </p>\" % (item, d[item])\nprint \"</BODY></HTML>\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you'll need to make the script executable by the Apache2\n\n\n# chown www-data:www-data /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n# chmod ug+x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Apache VirtualHost\n#\n\n\nYou are almost done! You'll need to configure mod_auth_openidc to\nprotect your server.\n\n\n# vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following right under \n<VirtualHost _default_:443>\n\n\nOIDCProviderMetadataURL https://idp.mydomain.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\nOIDCClientID (client-id-you-got-back-when-you-added-the-client)\nOIDCClientSecret (your-client-secret)\nOIDCRedirectURI https://www.mydomain.com/callback\nOIDCResponseType code\nOIDCScope \"openid profile email\"\nOIDCSSLValidateServer Off\nOIDCCryptoPassphrase (a-random-seed-value)\nOIDCPassClaimsAs environment\nOIDCClaimPrefix USERINFO_\nOIDCPassIDTokenAs payload\n<Location \"/\">\n    Require valid-user\n    AuthType openid-connect\n</Location>\n\n\n\n\n\nThen restart Apache to effect the changes\n\n\n# service apache2 restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most confusing part here is the \nOIDCRedirectURI\n--don't set this\nto a path used by your server. The apache-filter uses the redirect_uri \nto process the response from the OpenID Provider (Gluu Server). \n\n\nNow you're ready to test. Open your web browser, and point it at \n\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi\n \n\n\nIf you're not logged in already, you should be redirected to \nthe authentication page. If you are logged in, you should just see\nan html page with the \nREMOTE_USER\n variable populated. Also\ncheck out the \nOIDC_id_token_payload\n and all the claims for \n\nUSERINFO_\n \n\n\nInstallation\n#\n\n\nWe assume that all the hostnames will be dns resolvable. If not, then\nadd the according entries in \n/etc/hosts\n, please.\n\n\nAdd EPEL Repository\n#\n\n\nRun the following command to \nAdd EPEL Repo\n.\n\n\n\n\n# rpm -ivh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm\n\n\n\n\nApache Web Server\n#\n\n\nTo setup \nApache2 SSL\n, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the hiredis package is not found by the \nyum\n command, please download it manually from \nthis page\n and install it.\n\n\n\n\n# yum install httpd mod_ssl\n# yum install curl hiredis jansson\n\n\n\n\nConfigure SSL Module\n#\n\n\nThis section will guide you to create SSL certificates.\nUse the following commands to crete a  directory and generate the certificates.\n\n\n# mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl\n# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem -keyout /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter some values such as company name, country etc. Please enter them and your certificate will be ready. A template is given below\n\n\n    Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US\n    State or Province Name (full name) []:TX\n    Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Austin\n    Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Gluu\n    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:\n    Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:modauth-centos.info\n    Email Address []:support@gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to configure Apache to use the certificates and use the following command to edit the \nssl.conf\n file. \n\n\n# vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf\n\n\n\n\nThe important part of the configuration is to enter the path to the created SSL certificates. The example is given below.\n\n\nNote:\n Please make sure to use the correct server name in the configuration file.\n\n\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/ssl/httpd.key\n    ServerAdmin support@gluu.org\n    ServerName gluu.org\n\n\n\n\nRestart Apache Server and you are done configuring the SSL Module.

Open your web browser, and point it at\nhttps://www.mydomain.com/cgi-bin/printHeaders.cgi`\n\n\noxRay\n#\n\n\nLifeRay\n OpenID Connect plugin to authenticate users using\nGluu IdP.\n\n\nOverview\n#\n\n\nThe oxAuth LifeRay plugin is used to authenticate and auto-log users\nfrom Gluu Server into \nLifeRay\n with the same credentials. It\nis built on top of oxAuth, the OpenID Connect provider by Gluu.\n\n\nThe oxAuth plugin intercepts any attempt to login from anywhere in the\nLifeRay and redirects the request and the user to an oxAuth server where\nthe identification takes place, actually. If the user has authorized the\nserver to share some of his basic information with the oxAuth plugin,\nthe user will be redirected back to the LifeRay CMS, and logged in,\nautomatically.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to use the LifeRay CMS as the basis for an\norganizational personal data store service.\n\n\nNote: This plugin does not support auto-user creation from information\nsupplied by the oxAuth Plugin. Instead, it can be implemented by\nextending the plugin.\n\n\nDeployment\n#\n\n\nThe plugin is provided in two variants--\nMaven\n and \nAnt\n.\nYou can either use Maven or the LifeRay plugin SDK to build and deploy\nthis plugin as a standard LifeRay hot deployable WAR file.\n\n\nDeploying WAR file using Maven\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: make sure that you have \nMaven\n\ninstalled on your system to build this plugin from source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the Maven source from the [oxRay Repository][https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxRay/tree/master/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the file \npom.xml\n in \ngluu-openid-connect-hook\n, and update\nyour local LifeRay Tomcat bundle path. This is required for building the\nWAR file and deploying to the LifeRay Tomcat bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the \ngluu/6.2.x/maven/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n \ndirectory:\n\n\n\n\nmvn clean install package liferay:deploy\n\n\n\n\nThis will take a few seconds to download the dependency \njar\n files, and\ngenerate the LifeRay-compiled deployable WAR file. It will be placed\nwithin your \n<liferay-bundle-folder>/deploy\n directory, and the hot\ndeployable process will start.\n\n\nUsing LifeRay Plugin SDK With Ant\n#\n\n\nThis requires a prerequisite: we assume that you have the plugin SDK\nboth installed and configured with LifeRay bundle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout the gluu-openid-connect-hook plugin source from the\nrepository, and place these files in your local directory for the plugin\nSDK. Usually, this is \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command in the folder \nliferay-plugins-sdk-6.2.0-ce-ga1/hooks/gluu-openid-connect-hook\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nant clean deploy\n\n\n\n\nUsing Binary From Repository\n#\n\n\nYou can also download a compiled binary as a standard LifeRay deployable\nWAR file from the following location:\n\n\noxRay LifeRay Deployable War File\n\n\nCopy this WAR file in your LifeRay bundle. Usually, this is located at\n\nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1/deploy\n.\n\n\nOnce the plugin is deployed as a WAR file either using Maven or Ant, you\nwill see the following success message in your LifeRay Tomcat server:\n\n\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nA LifeRay application needs to be registered with the Authorization\nserver before initiating an authentication request/response with OAuth\nIdP server.\n\n\nThe following steps are necessary to obtain both a client id and a\nclient secret. These data will be used within the LifeRay portal\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the location \nhttps://seed.gluu.org/oxauth-rp/home.seam\n.\n\n\nYou will see the Dynamic Client Registration Section.\n\n\nEnter the Registration Endpoint uri, for example\n\nhttps://idp.example.org/oxauth/seam/resource/restv1/oxauth/authorize\n.\n\n\nYou can derive this uri from your IdP auto-discovery uri which is\nlike that: \nhttps://<Your IDP Server Domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nYou can search for the registration endpoint, and copy that uri here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter the redirect uris as \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n:\n\n\nReplace your domain name with \nlocalhost:8080\n\n\nThis will be your LifeRay handler for logging a user into LifeRay,\nautomatically, when a redirect comes back from the OAuth server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Response Types: CODE\n\n\nSelect the Application Type: WEB\n\n\nFor development purposes use: NATIVE (if you are testing on a local\nmachine with \nlocalhost:8080\n domain)\n\n\nEnter Client Name: LifeRay App (you can choose any name here).\n\n\nAll other options can be left as they are--please see the attached\nscreenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n, and both the following \nRegistration Request\n and\n\nRegistration Response\n will be displayed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Registration Response to your local system. The parameters\n\nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n are used in LifeRay when configuring\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\n\n\nModifying portal.properties\n#\n\n\nIt is necessary to modify \nportal-ext.properties\n file to reflect oxAuth\nserver client credentials and server's URL. It can be accomplished by\nnavigating into the \nliferay-portal-6.2.0-ce-ga1\n folder, where the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n is stored.\n\n\nNote: To either activate or deactivate the oxAuth plugin put the value\n\ntrue\n (to activate) or \nfalse\n (to deactivate), respectively.\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.auth.enabled=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\noxAuth client ID and client secret:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.id=@!1111!0008!51CE.1E59\ngluu.openidconnect.client.secret=65777eb7-87a8-4d60-9dbc-d31d43971f2b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server domain\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.domain=https://idp.gluu.org`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth server auto discovery uri\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.url.discovery=https://idp.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour OAuth server logout uri (typically, this will be used to logout a\nuser from OAuth when a user logs out from LifeRay)\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.idp.logout=https://idp.gluu.org/identity/logout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeRay server callback uri that will be used as a handling response\nby the OAuth server after authentication:\n\n\nreplace the \nlocalhost:8080\n with your LifeRay domain name:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.client.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback\n\n\n\n\n This page will be invoked when the user does not exist in the\n LifeRay database, but gets authenticated from the OAuth Server.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically, create a LifeRay page with the name \n/no-such-user-found\n,\n  or redirect to the LifeRay registration page uri like that:\n\n\n\n\ngluu.openidconnect.no.such.user.redirect.url=http://localhost:8080/no-such-user-found\n\n\n\n\nRestart the LifeRay server after editing the file\n\nportal-ext.properties\n.\n\n\nLogin Using the LifeRay Front End\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer Bootup\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay server is restarted, open your browser and\n  navigate to the uri \nhttp://localhost:8080\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin uri\n\n\n\n\nOnce the LifeRay page successfully loaded navigate to the OpenID\n  connect page at \nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: you can edit the theme code, and link to the login uri as\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/login\n. In result the user will\nalways redirect to the OAuth server for authentication.\n\n\n\n\nOAuth authentication\n\n\nThe LifeRay login uri will redirect users to the OAuth IdP server\n  for user authentication. Internally, passing the oAuth client id \n  as the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest for permission\n\n\nThis screen can be configured depending upon your OAuth Server\n  implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth callback (user auto-login to LifeRay)\n\n\nAfter a successful authentication with the OAuth server, IdP will\nsend a callback to LifeRay with a specific code as a parameter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/openidconnect/callback?code=xxx`\n\n\n\n\nThis will be intercepted by our oxAuth LifeRay plugin. Upon validation\nof the token with the Gluu IdP, it will result in a login of the user to\nthe LifeRay. The user will be redirected to his respective start page.\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect to authenticate a person in Java\n#\n\n\nThe \nOpenID Connect\n Protocol offers Java\ndevelopers a way to authenticate a person at any Internet domain that\nsupports the standard. To accomplish this, the domain must provide a way\nto register clients--the website and mobile applications that use the\nauthentication API offered by the domain.\n\n\nDiscovery\n#\n\n\nDiscovery is the first step! Luckily, its super-easy! All you have to \ndo is make a get request to\n\nhttps://{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration\n.\n\n\nThis will return a JSON object, as described in the\n\nspecification\n.\nFor example, you can see Gluu's OpenID Connect discovery\n\nurl\n.\n\n\nThis will tell you everything you need to know about this OpenID Connect\nprovider, like what are the endpoints (URLs), what crypto is supported,\nand what user claims can you ask for.\n\n\nAn \nexample\n\nof a Discovery Request, using the oxAuth RP library.\n\n\nClient Registration\n#\n\n\nIn SAML, the website was called a \"Service Provider.\" In OpenID Connect,\nthe website (or mobile application) is called a \"Client\". Clients can be\nregistered manually by the OP, but more frequently, clients use the\n\nDynamic Registration\nAPI\n to\nautomate the process.\n\n\nObtaining the id_token\n#\n\n\nAfter your client is registered, it is time to get down to business.\nOpenID Connect offers two common workflows for authentication: basic\n(where the person is using a browser, and can be re-directed) and\nimplicit where the client sends the credentials, including the secret.\nThere is a useful implements guide for\n\nbasic\n and\n\nimplicit\n.\n\n\nLogout\n#\n\n\nOpenID Connect defines a mechanism for \nSession\nManagement\n.\nThe idea is that JavaScript in a web tab can detect that another tab has\nlogged out. One detection of a logout event, the Web application can\ncleanup sessions in any backend systems as necessary. It is not 100%\neffective. If the tab is closed when the logout occurs in another tab,\nthe event may not be detected, and the backend systems are advised to\ntimeout sessions.\n\n\nUsing OpenID Connect from JavaScript\n#\n\n\nSee \nOpenID Connect plugin for Passport\n for further details.",

If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njwks\n\n\nClient's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsector_identifier_uri\n\n\nURL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject_type\n\n\nsubject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid_token_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_signed_response_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuserinfo_encrypted_response_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_alg\n\n\nJWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_object_encryption_enc\n\n\nJWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_method\n\n\nRequested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntoken_endpoint_auth_signing_alg\n\n\nJWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_max_age\n\n\nDefault Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequire_auth_time\n\n\nBoolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefault_acr_values\n\n\nDefault requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitiate_login_uri\n\n\nURI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_uris\n\n\nrequest_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n#\n\n\nClient Identificator or INUM, a client shared secret and the account expiration date in a [JSON[Response]]\n\n\nErrors\n#\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \nStatus Code\n\n        \nReason\n\n    \n\n    \n\n            \n400\n\n            \ninvalid_request\nThe request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter or parameter value, repeats the same parameter, uses more than one method for including an access token, or is otherwise malformed.

One of these registered Redirection URI values must exactly match the redirect_uri parameter value used in each Authorization Request    response_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 response_type values that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the code Response Type. Allowed values are code, token, id_token    grant_types  A list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using. The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are: authorization_code  The Authorization Code Grant Type implicit  The Implicit Grant Type refresh_token  The Refresh Token Grant Type The following table lists the correspondence between response_type values that the Client will use and grant_type values that MUST be included in the registered grant_types list: code: authorization_code id_token: implicit token id_token: implicit code id_token: authorization_code, implicit code token: authorization_code, implicit code token id_token: authorization_code, implicit    application_type  Kind of the application. The default, if omitted, is web. The defined values are native or web. Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type must only register URLs using the https scheme as redirect_uris; they must not use localhost as the hostname. Native Clients must only register redirect_uris using custom URI schemes or URLs using the http: scheme with localhost as the hostname.    contacts  e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.    client_name  Name of the Client to be presented to the End-User.    logo_uri  URL that references a logo for the Client application. If present, the server displays this image to the End-User during approval. The value of this field must point to a valid image file.    client_uri  URL of the home page of the Client. The value of this field must point to a valid Web page. If present, the server displays this URL to the End-User in a followable fashion.    policy_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the profile data will be used. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    tos_uri  URL that the Relying Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the Relying Party's terms of service. The value of this field must point to a valid web page. The OpenID Provider displays this URL to the End-User if it is given.    jwks_uri  URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document. If the Client signs requests to the Server, it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client. The JWK Set may also contain the Client's encryption keys(s), which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client. When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a use (Key Use) parameter value is required for all keys in the referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage. Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for both signatures and encryption, doing so is not recommended, as it is less secure. The JWK x5c parameter MAY be used to provide X.509 representations of keys provided. When used, the bare key values must still be present and must match those in the certificate.    jwks  Client's JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation (which jwks_uri does). The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together.    sector_identifier_uri  URL using the https scheme to be used in calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a file with a single JSON array of redirect_uri values. Providers that use pairwise sub (subject) values utilizes the sector_identifier_uri value provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.    subject_type  subject_type requested for responses to this Client. The subject_types_supported Discovery parameter contains a list of the supported subject_type values for this server. Valid types include pairwise and public.    id_token_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing the ID Token issued to this Client. The value none must not be used as the ID Token alg value unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow). The default, if omitted, is RS256. The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the JWK Set referenced by the jwks_uri element from OpenID Connect Discovery.    id_token_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If this is requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    id_token_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting the ID Token issued to this Client. If id_token_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When id_token_encrypted_response_enc is included, id_token_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    userinfo_signed_response_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) required for signing UserInfo Responses. If this is specified, the response will be JWT serialized, and signed using JWS. The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to return the Claims as a UTF-8 encoded JSON object using the application/json content-type.    userinfo_encrypted_response_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that no encryption is performed.    userinfo_encrypted_response_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) required for encrypting UserInfo Responses. If userinfo_encrypted_response_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When userinfo_encrypted_response_enc is included, userinfo_encrypted_response_alg must also be provided.    request_object_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing Request Objects sent to the OP. All Request Objects from this Client are rejected, if not signed with this algorithm. This algorithm is used both when the Request Object is passed by value (using the request parameter) and when it is passed by reference (using the request_uri parameter). The value none may be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP may be used.    request_object_encryption_alg  JWE alg algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter should be included when symmetric encryption will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP may still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT. The default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.    request_object_encryption_enc  JWE enc algorithm (JWA) the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg must also be provided.    token_endpoint_auth_method  Requested Client Authentication method for the Token Endpoint. The options are client_secret_post, client_secret_basic, client_secret_jwt, private_key_jwt, and none. If omitted, the default is client_secret_basic, the HTTP Basic Authentication Scheme.    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg  JWS alg algorithm (JWA) that must be used for signing the JWT used to authenticate the Client at the Token Endpoint for the private_key_jwt and client_secret_jwt authentication methods. All Token Requests using these authentication methods from this Client are rejected, if the JWT is not signed with this algorithm. The value none must not be used. The default, if omitted, is that any algorithm supported by the OP and the RP MAY be used.    default_max_age  Default Maximum Authentication Age. Specifies that the End-User must be actively authenticated if the End-User was authenticated longer ago than the specified number of seconds. The max_age request parameter overrides this default value. If omitted, no default Maximum Authentication Age is specified.    require_auth_time  Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time Claim in the ID Token is required. It is required when the value is true. (If this is false, the auth_time Claim can still be dynamically requested as an individual Claim for the ID Token using the claims request parameter) If omitted, the default value is false.    default_acr_values  Default requested Authentication Context Class Reference values. Array of strings that specifies the default acr values that the OP is being requested to use for processing requests from this Client, with the values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication Context Class satisfied by the authentication performed is returned as the acr Claim Value in the issued ID Token. The acr Claim is requested as a Voluntary Claim by this parameter. The acr_values_supported discovery element contains a list of the supported acr values supported by this server. Values specified in the acr_values request parameter or an individual acr Claim request override these default values.    initiate_login_uri  URI using the https scheme that a third party can use to initiate a login by the RP. The URI must accept requests via both GET and POST. The Client must understand the login_hint and iss parameters and should support the target_link_uri parameter.    request_uris  request_uri values that are pre-registered by the RP for use at the OP. The Servers cache the contents of the files referenced by these URIs and not retrieve them at the time they are used in a request. OPs can require that request_uri values used be pre-registered with the require_request_uri_registration discovery parameter. If the contents of the request file could ever change, these URI values should include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash value of the file contents referenced by the URI as the value of the URI fragment. If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server that its cached value for that URI with the old fragment value is no longer valid.",

SCIM uses a REST API for operations which are disabled by default. The support for SCIM must be enabled from the oxTrust admin interface. \nSCIM is enabled from the Organization Configuration in the oxTrust administration interface. Please navigate to \nOrganization Configuration\n --> \nSystem Configuration\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlease navigate down the page to find \nSCIM Support\n in the \nSYstem Configuration\n page and select \nEnabled\n.\n\n\n\n\nSCIM Endpoints\n#\n\n\nSCIM uses REST API for the operations which are covered in short in this section. There are two versions of the SCIM API each with its own specification. This usage of SCIM requires advanced level knowledge of HTTP GET and POST commands and not recommended for entry level users.\n\n\nThe SCIM 1.1 is governed by the \nSCIM:Protocol 1.1\n document and SCIM 2.0 is governed by the \nSCIM:Core Schema\n & \nSCIM:Protocol\n. As it is mentioned before, the specifications define an API, the operations are performed through endpoints. There are three endpoints that are available in Gluu Server SCIM:\n\n\n\n\nUser Endpoint\n\n\nGroup Endpoint\n\n\nBulk Operation Endpoint\n\n\n\n\nThe supported operations are given later in this document.\n\n\nSCIM 1.1\n#\n\n\nThe endpoints URLS are incomplete withour the hostname.

The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.\n\n\nThe authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies.

In practice, this likely \n        means that the URI reference used \n        by the client needs to be unique per resource set.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nstring\n\n        \noptional\n\n        \ntype\n\n        \nA string uniquely identifying the semantics of the \n        resource set.

It\nperforms a POST on the RPT endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header\nand a JSON object in the body with a \"ticket\" property containing the\nticket as its value.  If the client had included an RPT in its failed access attempt, It MAY\nalso provide that RPT in an \"rpt\" property in its request to the\nauthorization server.  In circumstances where the client needs to provide requesting party\nclaims to the authorization server, it MAY also include a \"claim_tokens\"\nproperty in its request; see Section 3.4.1.2.1 for more information. The\nauthorization server uses the ticket to look up the details of the\npreviously registered requested permission, maps the requested\npermission to operative resource owner policies based on the resource\nset identifier and scopes associated with it, potentially requests\nadditional information, and ultimately responds positively or negatively\nto the request for authorization data.  The authorization server bases the issuing of authorization data on\nresource owner policies. These policies thus amount to an asynchronous\nOAuth authorization grant. The authorization server is also free to\nenable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to\ninteract with the server in near-real time to provide consent subsequent\nto an access attempt.

The changes made this section will reflect in the logs.  <category name=\"org.xdi.oxauth\">\n        <priority value=\"TRACE\" />\n    </category>\n\n    <!- ############### Gluu ################# ->\n    <category name=\"org.gluu\">\n        <priority value=\"TRACE\" />\n    </category>\n\n    <!- ############### opnexdi ################# ->\n    <category name=\"org.openxdi\">\n        <priority value=\"TRACE\" />\n    </category>\n\n    <!- ############### oxTrust ################# ->\n    <category name=\"org.gluu.oxtrust\">\n        <priority value=\"TRACE\" />\n    </category>\n\n    <!- ############### Embedded JBoss AS ################# ->\n    <category name=\"org.jboss\">\n        <priority value=\"ERROR\" />\n    </category>\n    <category name=\"com.arjuna\">\n        <priority value=\"ERROR\" />\n    </category>  Please restart the specific service after any change in log levels to \nallow the changes to take effect.

Retrieve the data using the following command:\n\n\n# grep ldapPass= /install/community-edition-setup/*.last\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended to remove the file from any production environment or encrypt the file\n\n\n\n\nRevert Authentication Method\n#\n\n\nWhile testing authentication scripts and mechanisms it is not unlikely that you will find yourself locked out of the Gluu Server. In such a case the following method can be used to revert back to the previous authentication method:\n\n\n\n\nSame commands can be used for OpenLDAP as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to collect the \ninum\n for the Gluu Server installation:   \n\n\n$/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -Z -X -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -b \"ou=appliances,o=gluu\" -s one \"objectclass=*\" oxAuthenticationMode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nLDIF\n file with the contents below:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!1E3B.F133.14FA.5062!0002!4B66.CF9C,ou=appliances,o=gluu\n\n\nchangetype: modify\n\n\nreplace: oxAuthenticationMode\n\n\noxAuthenticationMode: internal\n\n\nAs an example, we shall call this file \nchangeAuth.ldif\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nReplace the \ninum\n from the example above with the \ninum\n of your Gluu Server from the \nldapsearch\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace the the authentication mode using \nldapmodify\n command.\n    \n$/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -p 1636 -Z -X -D 'cn=directory manager' -w 'YOUR_BIND_PASSWORD' -f ~/changeAuth.ldif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverting authentication could also done using LDAP browser and modifiying oxAuthenticationMode to 'internal'\n\n\n\n\nNo admin access after Cache Refresh?\n#\n\n\nAdd the password for your admin account to \n~/.pw\n and then use the commands below to add yourself as an admin.\n\n\n# set this to your actual user name\nexport newgluuadmin='myusername'\n\n# this is the file that will hold the info to be imported\nexport ldiffile='addManagers.ldif'\n\n# run this and verify that the output is for your account\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.\n 3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nuid: myusername\ngivenName: John\nsn: Doe\ncn: John Doe\n\n\n\n\nNow you can run these commands to make the file above:\n\n\nhead -n1 /opt/opendj/ldif/groups.ldif > $ldiffile\necho 'changetype: modify' >> $ldiffile\necho 'add: member' >> $ldiffile\necho \"member: $(/opt/opendj/bin/ldapsearch -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -b \"o=gluu\" \"uid=$newgluuadmin\" uid givenName sn cn |grep -A1 dn |cut -d ' ' -f 2- | sed 'N;s/\\n//')\" >> $ldiffile\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting ldif will look like this:\n\n\ndn: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0003!60B7,ou=groups,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\nchangetype: modify\nadd: member\nmember: inum=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C!0000!A8F2.DE1E.D7FB,ou=people,o=@!134D.3C3D.796E.FECE!0001!E022.CC3C,o=gluu\n\n\n\n\nOnce the ldif looks right, run this to grant your account admin rights in Gluu:\n\n\n/opt/opendj/bin/ldapmodify -h localhost -p 1636 -D \"cn=directory manager\" -j ~/.pw -Z -X -f addManagers.ldif\n\n\n\n\nLog into the web interface and pick up where you left off :)",

We need to create new Jetty Webapp configuration run oxAuth under Jetty on HTTPS port 8443\n\n\n2. We need to create new Jetty Webapp configuration run oxTrus under Jetty on HTTPS port 8453\n\n\n3. Before running both application we new to add VM argument (on Arguments tab): \n-Dgluu.base=<path_to_folder_with_ox_conf_folder>\n. It should specify path with 'conf' folder which contains 'ox-ldap.properties' and 'salt' files\n\n\n4. Start applications in next order: oxAuth, oxTrust\n\n\n5.
